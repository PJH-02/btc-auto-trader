XRP price poised for 46% gains after Ripple secures first Dubai license,https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-price-46-gains-after-ripple-secures-first-dubai-license,2025-03-14,"XRP
XRP
$2.29
price is eyeing a breakout from a classic chart pattern in the near future after Ripple acquired its first-ever license in the Middle East.
XRP price chart hints at possible 46% gains
XRP has been consolidating inside a descending triangle pattern since topping out at its seven-year high of $3.40 on Jan. 16. 
After finding support from the triangle’s horizontal line at $2.00, the XRP/USD pair has left behind a sequence of higher lows over the last four days to its upper trendline, as shown in the chart below.

XRP‘s price is now testing the triangle‘s upper trendline at $2.30, raising hopes of a daily candlestick close above this level.
If this happens, XRP could rally toward the $3.00 psychological level, a critical supplier congestion zone that has rejected the price twice in recent times.
A move past this level would push the price toward the next major resistance at $3.27 and later to the multi-year high at $3.40, amounting to a rise between 30% and 46%.
Meanwhile, popular crypto analyst CrediBull Crypto says XRP’s drop to sub-$2.00 levels provided a perfect entry for buyers, targeting profits around $3.40.

This approval, Ripple’s first in the Middle East, will allow the payments company to tap into the UAE’s $40 billion remittance and $400 billion international trade markets.

Following the announcement, XRP price gained 6% from a low of $2.21 to a high of $2.34 on March 11, reflecting market optimism.
“Ripple’s DFSA license in Dubai’s DIFC marks a game-changer, ” said popular commentator Vincent van Code in a March 13 post on X, adding that it positions the” company as a leader in regulated crypto payments across the UAE’s $40B cross-border market.”
“This could unlock massive potential for XRP, driving adoption and growth as blockchain transforms global finance.”

Ripple’s battle with SEC nears an end
Another potential catalyst for XRP price is the possible end of the SEC’s case against Ripple.
Ripple’s prolonged legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since 2020 over allegations of unregistered XRP sales may be nearing a resolution.
The July 2023 ruling by Judge Torres, deeming XRP not a security for retail sales but fining Ripple $125 million for institutional violations, marked a turning point. Recent reports suggest both parties might drop their appeals, with Ripple negotiating better terms amid a perceived shift in SEC priorities under new leadership.
“The SECGov vs. Ripple case is in the process of wrapping up and could be over soon,” said Fox Business’s Eleanor Terret, citing two unmentioned sources.
Terret explained the SEC could be reconsidering its aggressive crypto enforcement, potentially aligning with a more lenient regulatory stance.
“The argument, I’m told, is that the new SEC leadership is wiping the enforcement slate clean for all previously targeted crypto firms because it believes regulatory clarity will resolve the underlying issue.”
As Cointelegraph reported, several cases against several crypto companies were dismissed in recent weeks, including Coinbase, Robinhood and Kraken, by the new SEC administration under acting Chair Mark Uyeda.

Crypto regulation shifts as Bitcoin eyes $105K amid liquidity boost,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-regulation-shifts-as-bitcoin-eyes-105-k-amid-liquidity-boost,2025-03-13,"Bitcoin
BTC
$82,292
price has risen 8% from its March 11 low of $76,703, driven in part by large investors aggressively buying the dip with leverage.
Margin longs on Bitfinex surged to their highest level since November 2024, adding 13,787 BTC over 17 days. Currently standing at $5.7 billion, this bullish leveraged positioning signals confidence in Bitcoin’s upside potential despite recent price weakness.

Some analysts argue that Bitcoin’s price is closely linked to the global monetary base, meaning it tends to rise as central banks inject liquidity.
With recession risks mounting, the likelihood of expansionary monetary policies increasing the money supply grows. If this correlation holds, Bitfinex whales could be well-positioned to capitalize on a rally above $105,000 in the next two months.

For instance, X user Pakpakchicken claims to have identified an 82% correlation between the global money supply (M2) and Bitcoin’s price.
When central banks drain liquidity by raising interest rates or reducing bond holdings, traders become more risk-averse, leading to weaker demand for Bitcoin. Conversely, periods of monetary easing tend to fuel greater investor interest in the asset, increasing its price potential.

Bitfinex whales go long BTC as M2 bottoms
In early September 2024, Bitfinex margin traders added 7,840 BTC in long positions, coinciding with a period of bearish momentum as Bitcoin struggled to reclaim the $50,000 level for over three months.
Despite the downturn, Bitfinex whales held their positions, and Bitcoin’s price surged past $75,000 less than two months later. Notably, the global M2 money supply bottomed out around the same time these traders increased their Bitcoin exposure, further reinforcing the correlation.
It may be impossible to establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship between money supply and investors’ willingness to accumulate Bitcoin, especially given the influence of major events during these periods.
For example, Donald Trump’s election as US president in November 2024 significantly fueled Bitcoin’s rally due to the new administration’s pro-crypto stance, regardless of global M2 trends and liquidity conditions.

Similarly, Michael Saylor’s latest plan to raise up to $21 billion in fresh capital for Strategy to acquire more Bitcoin could shift market dynamics, even accounting for the $4.1 billion in net outflows from Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since Feb. 24.
Strategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 499,096 BTC acquired at a total cost of $33.1 billion, reinforcing its long-term bullish strategy.
Clearer crypto regulation, Strategy capital increase
In essence, the expansion of the global money supply may have influenced the increase in Bitfinex margin longs, but Bitcoin’s push toward $105,000 could be primarily driven by industry-specific news and events.
A Wall Street Journal report on March 13 revealed that representatives of Donald Trump have held discussions about potentially acquiring a stake in Binance.

So far, the market impact of a more crypto-friendly US government has yet to yield concrete benefits.
For example, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has not yet clarified whether banks can custody digital assets and manage stablecoins without prior approval.
Similarly, Acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda announced plans to remove crypto-specific provisions from a proposed rule that would expand exchange definitions.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission is currently reviewing requests from spot Bitcoin ETF issuers to permit in-kind creations and redemptions, allowing shares to be exchanged directly for Bitcoin instead of using the traditional cash-based method.
Meanwhile, global macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated, putting pressure on Bitcoin’s price. However, these same factors gradually push governments toward economic stimulus measures and expand the M2 money supply.
If this trend continues, it should ultimately create conditions for Bitcoin's price to meet Pakpakchicken’s $105,000 prediction by May 2025 and possibly go even higher.

Solana price bottom below $100? Death cross hints at 30% drop,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-price-bottom-below-100-death-cross-30-drop,2025-03-13,"Solanaprice completed a “death cross” on the one-day chart on March 12, as the altcoin consolidated near its long-term support level at $125.
This could potentially accelerate the SOL price sell-off in the near term for a drop below $100 for the first time since February 2024.
Solana’s 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
A death cross occurs when a bearish crossover occurs between the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs), with the long-term indicator above the short-term indicator.
Last month, the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) triggered a death cross on Solana’s one-day chart, after which prices dropped 17%, from $137 to $122.
While the SMA and EMA death crosses carry similar implications, the EMA triggers the death cross faster since it responds more quickly to price changes. A double death cross from the SMA and EMA will likely increase the possibility of a correction.
Historically, the odds are neutral for Solana. Since its inception, SOL’s price has witnessed a death cross three times (including 2025) when prices have been on a 90-day or higher downtrend.
The first death cross in 2022 triggered a 90% collapse, but the FTX’s fiasco escalated its severity. The second death cross occurred in September 2024, but it reversed within a month, leading to the Trump rally.

Yet, the current structure and sentiment mirror the 2022 death cross when we compare market conditions. On both occasions, a new all-time high preceded the downtrend, which led to the death cross.
As Cointelegraph reported, Solana’s revenue dropped 93% since January, dropping from $238 million to $32 million. This indicates a current lack of activity on Solana’s network after the end of the memecoin frenzy.
Can Solana traders defend $125?
Based on its technicals, Solana remains in a tricky spot when comparing previous death cross returns and collective market sentiment.
Solana must hold support between $125 and $110 for a bullish reversal. Since March 2024, SOL prices have rebounded six times after testing the support range, closing above $125 on each weekly retest.

A weekly close below $125 will signal market weakness, potentially increasing the likelihood of a drop below $100. The immediate price target after $110 is around $80 for Solana, which is a significant 30% correction. The downtrend target carries confluence with the weekly 0.5 Fibonacci retracement line.

However, the bulls will pin their hopes on a bullish divergence between the price and relative strength index (RSI) on the 1-day and 4-hour charts.
If Solana manages to avoid another lower low, the divergences will remain valid, which can push prices higher above $125, enabling Solana to avoid a drop below $100 and possibly establish a bottom at $112.

Bitcoin follows stocks lower
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD circling $81,500, down 2.3% on the day.
The February print of the Producer Price Index (PPI) came in below median expectations, copying the Consumer Price Index (CPI) results from the day prior.
“On an unadjusted basis, the index for final demand advanced 3.2 percent for the 12 months ended in February,” an accompanying press release from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) stated.
“In February, a 0.3-percent increase in prices for final demand goods offset a 0.2-percent decline in the index for final demand services.”

Despite this, both stocks and crypto remained unmoved, leading trading resource The Kobeissi Letter to tie in the ongoing US trade war.
“As we have seen, the market has had a very MUTED reaction to inflation data that would’ve previously sent the S&P 500 SHARPLY higher,” it wrote in part of its latest analysis on X.
“Why is this the case? This data provides President Trump a reason to keep doing what he is currently doing.”

Kobeissi explained that trader war efforts may now intensify, given slowing inflation.
“This is exactly why markets are not recovering losses following some of the best inflation data in months,” it continued, suggesting traders should “buckle up for more volatility.”
A week before the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate decision, market expectations for financial easing remained similarly lackluster, with the chance of a cut at just 1%, per data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool. Odds for the Fed’s May meeting were at 28%.

“The Fed has already decided: steady course, no cuts this FOMC. Powell made that clear last week,” popular crypto trader Josh Rager told X followers earlier in the week, referencing a recent speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. 
“Rate cuts? More likely in May/June, not March.”
BTC price inertia leaves key resistance intact
Bitcoin price action thus sat between bands of buy and sell liquidity on exchange order books, with the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) in place as resistance.

For Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, this trendline, which typically functions as support during Bitcoin bull markets, was the nearest important level to reclaim.
“Bitcoin faces strong resistance at the 200-Day MA for the 4th consecutive day,” he summarized on X.
Referring to Material Indicators’ proprietary trading tools, Alan concluded that such a reclaim was unlikely on the day, notwithstanding surprise catalysts in the form of announcements from the US government.

Trump family held talks with Binance for stake in crypto exchange — Report,https://cointelegraph.com/news/trump-family-had-talks-for-stake-in-binance-crypto-exchange-report,2025-03-13,"Representatives of US President Donald Trump’s family have reportedly held talks with Binance about acquiring a stake in the crypto exchange.
Binance reached out to Trump’s family representatives in 2024, offering to strike a deal as part of a plan to resume Binance.US operations in the country, The Wall Street Journal reported on March 13.
Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report mentioned that Binance’s billionaire founder Changpeng Zhao — who served four months in prison in the US — has been pushing for the Trump administration to grant him a pardon.
“It is unclear what form the Trump family stake would take if the deal comes together or whether it would be contingent on a pardon,” the report said.
World Liberty Financial among deal options
According to WSJ, a potential opportunity could be a scenario where Trump takes the stake in Binance or proceeds with the deal through World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a Trump-backed crypto venture launched in September 2024.
Trump has emerged as the first US “crypto president,” launching his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin days before returning to the White House on Jan. 20. A similar memecoin subsequently came from Trump’s wife, Melania, while Trump’s son, Eric Trump, has been actively pushing for Bitcoin  and crypto adoption.
Cointelegraph approached Binance for a comment regarding the report on the alleged deal but did not receive a response by publication.
Additionally, Binance executives anticipated a potential legal resolution in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) civil case against Tron founder Justin Sun, The WSJ reported.
Sun, who in November 2024 announced a $30 million investment in Trump’s WLFI, jointly asked a US court to halt his case with the SEC in February 2025.
Neither Sun nor any Binance representatives attended the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, 2025.
Trump slams WSJ for “polluted thinking” of the EU
Minutes before the WSJ article was published at 1:00 pm UTC, Trump took to Truth Social to slam the publication for allegedly reporting wrong information.
“The Globalist Wall Street Journal has no idea what they are doing or saying. They are owned by the polluted thinking of the European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of ‘screwing’ the United States of America,” the president wrote.

While Trump was fast to address the WSJ report minutes before its publication, key Trump-linked industry figures — including Elon Musk and David Sacks — did not react to the news on social media.
Source: Changpeng Zhao
Zhao subsequently took to X to deny the allegations, suggesting that the WSJ article is “motivated as an attack on the president and crypto.”
“Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance.US deal with … well, anyone,” CZ wrote.

Binance CEO praises Trump as a catalyst for a “global pro-crypto shift”
Meanwhile, Binance CEO Richard Teng did not immediately respond to the report within the first hour of its publication.
Instead, Teng took to X on March 13 to highlight his new interview with CNBC, where he praised Trump as a catalyst for a “global pro-crypto shift.” Teng expressed confidence that the crypto industry is widely supporting Trump, stating:
“If you ask anybody in the crypto industry, people prefer the current administration compared to the last one.”
Still, some apparently have not been happy with all of Trump’s crypto policies, with many advocating for Bitcoin-only US reserves instead of a multi-crypto approach that has been eventually chosen by the administration.
House Democrats have also been concerned about the plummeting TRUMP memecoin, proposing legislation to ban the issuance of memecoins by any US public officials.

Will Bitcoin price reclaim $95K before the end of March?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/will-bitcoin-price-reclaim-95k-before-end-march,2025-03-13,"Bitcoin’s price was up 3% after constant drawdowns since the end of January. The top cryptocurrency managed to rebound above $80,000 after a brief decline below the range on March 11.
Bitcoin weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
After the US core Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in lower than expected at 3.1% on March 12, Bitcoin's market structure now sees the possibility of a quick bullish turnaround.
Bitcoin liquidity clusters at $84K-$85K
After Bitcoin's price tumbled on March 9, it rebounded to test the overhead resistance zone between $84,000 and $85,000 three times, spurring traders to aggressively build short positions in this range.
The liquidation heatmap data suggested that more than $300 million in short positions were piled in this price region, which would be liquidated if the price moved above the $85,000 resistance.

With a lack of downside liquidity below $77,000, the probability of BTC moving toward upside liquidity increased. Moreover, triggering liquidations above $85,000 could fuel further bullish momentum, allowing Bitcoin to form a higher high and turn this level into new support.
A CME Bitcoin futures gap from the previous weekend also remained unfilled between $85,000 and $86,000. With a 100% record of six gaps filled in the past four months, this setup further increased the chances of flipping the overhead resistance into support at $85,000.
Bitcoin 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
If this happens, the next major resistance lies at $90,000, which could liquidate over $1.6 billion in short positions for a retest of the $95,000 resistance level above, i.e., a 12% jump from the current price.
Related: Bitcoin must secure weekly close above $89K to confirm bottom has passed
Bitcoin analyst Mark Cullen underlined a similar outlook for Bitcoin but warned that the price continues to move “correctively,” implying further sideways movement before a short squeeze.
On the contrary, Valeria, a crypto analyst and funded trader, said that BTC was showing signs of distribution near the $85,000 range, which is short-term bearish. The trader highlighted that the BTC price might thread lower below $80,000 before a bullish breakout occurs.
Coinbase, Binance diverge on orderbook trends
Spot traders on Binance have been aggressively selling over the past few days, according to data from Aggr.trade, with selling pressure peaking during the local lows at $76,650.
Conversely, Coinbase spot buyers placed bids here, leading to BTC’s rebound above $80,000.

On March 12, a similar discrepancy was observed, with Binance spot traders selling near the $85,000 resistance, as Coinbase traders defended the price at $81,000 during the early US trading session, avoiding further downside.
Related: Crypto trading volume slumps, signaling market exhaustion: Analysis
While Coinbase has led BTC’s rally in the past, an opposing stance between the two leading exchanges might slow BTC’s momentum to move swiftly through the resistance levels.
Thus, for Bitcoin to reclaim higher highs at $85,000, $90,000 and $95,000 over the next couple of weeks, spot trading activity between the two major exchanges may need more collective direction.

Bybit CEO on ‘brutal’ $4M Hyperliquid loss: Lower leverage as positions grow,https://cointelegraph.com/news/hyperliquid-4-million-loss-leverage-eth-trader,2025-03-13,"Bybit CEO Ben Zhou commented on a recent $4 million loss suffered by decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid due to an Ether whale’s high-leverage trade, noting that centralized exchanges (CEXs) face similar challenges.
On March 12, a crypto investor walked away with $1.8 million and forced the Hyperliquidity Pool (HLP) to bear a $4 million loss after a trade that used leverage on the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange (DEX). 
The trader used about 50x leverage to turn $10 million into a $270 million Ether

$1,897
long position. However, the trader couldn’t exit without tanking their own position. Instead, they withdrew collateral, offloading assets without triggering a self-inflicted price drop, leaving Hyperliquid to cover the losses.
Smart contract auditor Three Sigma said the trade was a “brutal game of liquidity mechanics,” not a bug or an exploit. Hyperliquid also clarified that this was not a protocol exploit or a hack.

Hyperliquid lowers leverage trading for BTC and ETH
In response to the trade, Hyperliquid lowered its Bitcoin
BTC
$82,406
leverage to 40x and its ETH leverage allowance to 25x. This increases the maintenance margin requirements for larger positions on the DEX. “This will provide a better buffer for backstop liquidations of larger positions,” Hyperliquid stated. 
In an X post, the Bybit CEO commented on the trade, saying that CEXs are also subjected to the same situation. Zhou said their liquidation engine takes over whale positions when they get liquidated. While lowering the leverage may be an effective solution, Zhou said this could be bad for business: 
“I see that HP has already lowered their overall leverage; that’s one way to do it and probably the most effective one, however, this will hurt business as users would want higher leverage.”
Zhou suggested a more dynamic risk limit mechanism that reduces the overall leverage as the position grows. The executive said that in a centralized platform, the whale would go down to a leverage of 1.5x with the huge amount of open positions. Despite this, the executive recognized that users could still use multiple accounts to achieve the same results.
The Bybit CEO added that even the lowered leverage capabilities could still be “abused” unless the DEX implements risk management measures such as surveillance and monitoring to spot “market manipulators” on the same level as a CEX.

3 reasons why Ethereum can outperform its rivals after crashing to 17-month lows,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-can-outperform-rivals-crashing-17-month-lows,2025-03-13,"Ether fell 13% between March 8 and March 11 as investors moved to short-term fixed-income and cash positions, seeking safety amid a global tariff war and rising fears of an economic downturn.
ETH price needs 29% gains to reclaim $2.5K
Market concerns escalated after the United States responded to Canada’s electricity surcharge with retaliatory measures.

Typically, traders tend to overreact, increasing the likelihood that Ether will rebound faster than other assets once market sentiment improves. While some argue that risk assets are driven by inflation and economic growth data, others believe gains depend on stimulus measures and monetary expansion.
Regardless of the catalyst for the next bull run, Ether price must climb 29% from its current $1,940 level to reclaim $2,500. This move will likely require increased demand from leveraged buyers, whose activity is now at its lowest point in five months.
ETH 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch/Cointelegraph
Traders want higher prices to compensate for longer settlement periods, making a 5% to 10% annualized premium (basis rate) expected in neutral markets. When rates fall below this range—such as the current 4.5%—it signals weak bullish conviction.
Excessive optimism played a role in Ether’s recent correction, as $235 million in leveraged long positions were liquidated between March 10 and March 11.
The panic selling drove ETH to a low of $1,744, its lowest level since October 2023. However, several indicators suggest a potential recovery, as ETH derivatives and onchain metrics show resilience.
Ethereum L2 network grows
Ether is trading 60% below its $4,868 all-time high from November 2021. This decline is largely due to increased competition in the smart contract sector and waning demand for applications such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming, collectibles, metaverse projects, social networks, and Web3 infrastructure.
However, this perspective overlooks a key factor. In late 2021, the average transaction fee exceeded $50, while activity on Ethereum’s layer-2 ecosystem was 97% lower than it is today.
For context, a token swap on Ethereum’s base layer cost $1.70 on March 11 despite the number of daily average operations per second growing, highlighting notable progress in network efficiency.

Even if bots generate 80% of layer-2 transactions, the remaining 20% of activity on Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, ZKsync, and Blast is still roughly three times higher than Ethereum’s base layer. However, critics have a valid argument: despite the surge in network activity, validators are earning significantly less compared to late 2021.
Ethereum regains DEX top-spot, TVL grows
Ethereum has reinforced its position as the second-most popular option for institutional investors in traditional finance, supported by $8.9 billion in spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Meanwhile, competitors such as Solana still await regulatory approval for similar ETF products. Even if they gain approval, they cannot match the first-mover advantage of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which began public trading on over-the-counter markets in June 2019.
Moreover, Ethereum smart contract deposits, measured by total value locked (TVL), reached their highest level since July 2022 in ETH terms on March 11, marking a 10% increase over the past two weeks.

Ethereum network TVL, ETH. Source: DefiLlama
At 24 million ETH, Ethereum’s TVL has been driven by the growth of liquid staking, lending, yield farming, and real-world asset tokenization. The network recently reclaimed its leading position in decentralized exchange volumes, reaching $20.5 billion over seven days and surpassing Solana’s $13.9 billion, according to DefiLlama data.
This provided a bullish outlook for ETH’s price, driven by layer-2 transactions nearing all-time highs, reclaiming of the top spot in DEX volume, and rising TVL deposits.
Ultimately, Ether’s trend reversal remains highly dependent on macroeconomic improvements, but once stabilized, ETH is well-positioned to regain $2,500 as a key support level in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin must secure weekly close above $89K to confirm bottom has passed,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-weekly-close-89k-bottom-resume-uptrend-crypto-analyst,2025-03-13,"Bitcoin must close the week above $89,000 to signal an end to the short-term downtrend, says a crypto analyst.
“The only way for Bitcoin to confirm that the bottom is actually in would be to close a weekly back above $89K,” crypto analyst Matthew Hyland said in a video posted to X on March 13.

last traded at $89,000 on March 7, a level Hyland considers crucial since it was the support area where Bitcoin ultimately ended up “breaking down below.” After falling below $89,000, it dropped to $78,523 on March 11 before stabilizing in the low $80,000s.
With Bitcoin currently trading at $83,406, a move above $89,000 would liquidate approximately $1.60 billion in short positions, as per CoinGlass data.

If Bitcoin fails to close above it, Hyland warned the asset’s price could drop to between $74,000 to $69,000, a level Bitcoin hasn’t seen since November.
“It probably is likely at this point that going into the coming weeks or the coming months, Bitcoin will likely test this lower range at some point of support,” he said.
“If we do get a weekly close above this area, I think the low is in for Bitcoin, and we are not going down to this area,” he said. Hyland said that it typically leads to further upside when Bitcoin breaks above a resistance level.
Bitcoin demand in the US has declined
However, demand for Bitcoin in the US has been declining recently due to macroeconomic factors.
Bitcoin’s demand fell by 103,000 BTC last week compared to the previous week, “marking its fastest pace of contraction since July 2024,” according to CryptoQuant.

CryptoQuant said the recent decline in Bitcoin’s demand in the US was due to uncertainty around US inflation rates and US President Donald Trump’s imposed tariffs on Feb. 1. 
On March 7, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell reiterated that he was in no hurry to adjust interest rates.

Ethereum 'falling knife' warning: Is another 30% crash versus Bitcoin coming?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-falling-knife-another-30-crash-bitcoin,2025-03-13,"Ethereum’s native token, Ether
ETH
$1,896
, has dropped to its multi-year lows against Bitcoin
BTC
$82,399
, prompting analysts to predict further declines in the coming weeks.
Falling knife warning furthers sell-off risks
On March 13, ETH/BTC—a pair that tracks Ether’s strength against Bitcoin—dropped by over 1.50% to reach $0.022, its lowest level since May 2020.
ETH’s descent is part of its multi-year downtrend that started when it established a record high of $0.156 in June 2017. Since then, it has plunged by more than 85%, underscoring Ether’s growing weakness against Bitcoin.
Meanwhile, on the two-week ETH/BTC chart, the relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator used to measure whether an asset is overbought or oversold, has fallen to a record low of 23.32.

Typically, when RSI drops below 30, it signals oversold conditions, potentially leading to a price rebound.
However, in Ethereum’s case, RSI has continued to plunge even lower even two months after becoming oversold, suggesting that ETH’s downtrend is still accelerating rather than stabilizing.
Crypto analyst Alessandro Ottaviani has described the situation as a “falling knife” scenario—a term used to describe an asset that is experiencing a rapid and steep decline, often discouraging buyers from stepping in too soon.
A falling knife implies that attempting to catch the asset at a perceived low could lead to further losses if the downtrend persists.
For Ethereum to signal a potential reversal, traders will be watching for RSI stabilization and reclaim of key resistance levels. That ideally begins with a rebound from the 0.022 BTC level, which had limited ETH/BTC’s downside attempts in December 2020, leading to a 300% rally.

Should a rebound happen, the ETH/BTC pair can rally toward its 0.382 Fibonacci retracement line at around 0.038 BTC, aligning with the 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave).
Until then, the technical outlook suggests that ETH/BTC could remain trapped in its falling knife trajectory, with the next potential downside targets at historical support levels inside the 0.020-0.016 BTC range.

The lowest point of this range is approximately 30% below the current price levels.
ETH/BTC fundamentals support a bearish outlook
Ether’s prospects of declining further against Bitcoin are rooted in factors beyond technical analysis.
For instance, Ethereum currently faces strong competition from rival layer-1 blockchains, namely Solana

VanEck noted that Solana’s decentralized exchange volume has surpassed Ethereum’s even during a steep dropoff in memecoin trading activity. Meanwhile, Solana’s volume has risen consistently in recent months, which coincides with a decline in Ethereum’s volumes.

Furthermore, the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has fundamentally altered the traditional crypto market cycle that used to benefit Ethereum and other altcoins.
Historically, after Bitcoin surged post-halving, capital rotated into altcoins, triggering an “altseason” where ETH and other assets outperformed BTC. However, the $129 billion inflows into Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 have disrupted this cycle, draining liquidity from the broader altcoin market—including Ethereum.

Another factor is Ethereum-specific selling pressure.
The recent Bybit hack reportedly led to substantial ETH liquidations, with some of that value laundered via decentralized platforms like Thorchain. This absorbed sell-off may still be rippling through the market, depressing ETH’s relative value.

ETH/BTC hits 5-year low as trader suggests rotation into stronger alts,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ether-bitcoin-ratio-multi-year-low-rotate-altcoins-crypto-analyst,2025-03-13,"Ethereum's value against Bitcoin has hit its lowest level since mid-2020, with a crypto trader suggesting that it might be time to shift into higher-performing altcoins.
“If still stuck on ETH, it is likely a good time to dump it to buy a higher beta altcoin,” economist and crypto trader Alex Kruger said in a March 12 X post.
ETH/BTC ratio is an altcoin season indicator
“If the market goes down, you’ll likely lose equally in both cases, but if it goes up, you’ll likely outperform significantly and can then swap into BTC,” Kruger opined.
The ETH/BTC ratio — which shows Ether’s relative strength compared to Bitcoin — is sitting at 0.02281, its lowest level in nearly five years, according to TradingView data.

Both the leading cryptocurrencies by market cap are trading below key psychological price levels. Bitcoin is trading at $83,667 — having remained below the $100,000 level since Feb. 5 — while Ether is at $1,907, floating below $2,000 since March 10.
Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures overall market sentiment, read a “Fear” score of 45, up 11 points from yesterday’s score.

Many in the crypto industry see the ETH/BTC ratio “bottoming out” as a sign that altcoin season could kick off. On Feb. 14, Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen said on X to get an altcoin season, “ETH/BTC needs to bottom and start trending higher.”
Bitcoin season could dominate
However, other indicators suggest that altcoin season may not come so soon, and Bitcoin may continue to hold market share in the near term.
CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index — which bases the performance of the top 100 altcoins relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days — reads a score of 13 out of 100, leaning more toward Bitcoin season.

Pseudonymous crypto trader and Pear Protocol adviser Hansolar said in a March 13 X post that it will be Bitcoin season “all year round.”
The trader said altcoin season was only 16 days last year and happened when Bitcoin’s Dominance dropped from 61% on Nov. 20 to 55% on Dec. 5 before rebounding to 59% by Dec. 21.
At the time of publication, Bitcoin dominance stands at 62.15%, according to TradingView.
When Ether hit its all-time high of $4,800 in November 2021, Bitcoin's dominance was approximately 42%.

"Crypto trading volume slumps, signaling market exhaustion: Analysis",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-volume-decline-reflects-diminishing-trader-enthusiasm-analysts,2025-03-13,"Crypto trading volumes and dwindling digital asset prices are flashing signs of trader exhaustion and potentially weaker market momentum, according to analysts. 
Crypto-wide trading volume has been dropping since it peaked in February amid dip-buying opportunities. According to CoinGecko data, daily trading volume hit its highest level this year in early February when it reached $440 billion. It has since sunk by 63% to $163 billion on March 12. 
Market data firm CoinMarketCap has slightly lower figures but they show the same trend — that volume peaked in 2025 in early March before falling back 52% to current levels.  
Analytics firm Santiment said on X on March 13 that this decline in volume suggests that trader enthusiasm for the asset class is diminishing.
“When trading volume for major cryptocurrencies consistently drops, even during slight price recoveries, it typically points toward diminishing trader enthusiasm.”
Santiment added that trader behavior “indicates a mix of exhaustion, hopelessness, and capitulation” following further market capitalization declines over the past fortnight.

Total market capitalization has declined almost 25% since the beginning of February, shrinking by $900 billion as the crypto market correction deepens. 
Those declines have accelerated over the past 10 days when markets have lost 15% as fears of a recession in the United States increased amid escalating global trade tensions.
Santiment stated that traders are becoming cautious, suggesting they might not believe that the current upward price movements will last. “Essentially, reduced trading activity reflects uncertainty, as fewer traders are convinced that buying at current levels will yield profitable outcomes,” the analysts added.
Weakening trading volume amid minor price bounces can serve as an “early warning sign of weakening market momentum,” Santiment reported, adding that without robust buying participation, price gains can quickly lose steam, “as there simply isn’t enough underlying support to sustain the upward trend.”
“This leads to the possibility that any rebound could be temporary, with prices vulnerable to another downturn.”
Related: Bitcoin high-entry buyers are driving sell pressure, price may ‘floor’ at $70K
However, shrinking volume during minor rebounds isn’t necessarily a direct bearish signal, it said, adding that volume is a metric that measures participation from both retail and institutional traders and it needs to start rising before prices do.
 “To signal a healthier and more sustainable recovery, bulls generally will want to see both rising prices and rising volumes simultaneously.”
Crypto market capitalization is currently around $2.8 trillion, which is where it was this time last year before seven months of consolidation followed. 
Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains in “fear” territory, below 50, where it has been since Feb. 21.

"Bitcoin dominance hits new highs, alts fade: Research",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-dominance-reaches-new-highs-alts-fade,2025-03-12,"Bitcoin’s dominance has crested new highs as altcoins’ short-lived rally fizzles, according to data from Matrixport, a cryptocurrency financial services platform. 
As of March 12, Bitcoin dominance — a measure of Bitcoin’s share of crypto’s overall market capitalization — stands at 61.2%, according to Matrixport. This is up from a cycle low of around 54% in December. 
Rising BTC dominance is “clear evidence that the altcoin rally was short-lived,” Matrixport said in a post on the X platform. 
“It lasted barely a month, from [US President Donald] Trump’s election in November to early December, when a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report shifted market focus toward a more hawkish Federal Reserve,” Matrixport said. 
Bitcoin’s dominance typically wanes near the end of market cycles as capital rotates into altcoins — digital assets besides Bitcoin.

Eyeing interest rates
In January, the US Federal Reserve opted to hold interest rates steady instead of starting another round of cuts, citing healthy US jobs data. 
The Fed’s hawkish tone dealt a blow to stocks and cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s spot price has dropped approximately 20% since the central bank’s Jan. 29 announcement. As of March 12, Bitcoin trades at roughly $82,750. It hit an all-time high of more than $109,000 in December. 
Altcoins are even more sensitive to macroeconomic volatility than Bitcoin. “Savvy traders have rotated out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, which, despite its own decline, has significantly outperformed the broader crypto market,” Matrixport said. 
The next leg of Bitcoin’s rally depends largely on whether the Fed opts to hike interest rates to stave off inflation, Matrixport noted. 
On March 12, the February Consumer Price Index — a measure of US inflation — came in lower than expected at around 2.8%. 
“This marks the first decline in both Headline and Core CPI since July 2024,” The Kobeissi Letter said in an X post. “Inflation is cooling down in the US.”
Data from the CME Group, a US derivatives exchange, indicates that markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed to hold rates steady at its next meeting in March.

SEC postpones ruling on Fidelity Ether ETF options,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-delays-decision-on-fidelity-eth-etf-options,2025-03-12,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission has postponed ruling on whether or not to permit Cboe BZX Exchange to list options tied to asset manager Fidelity’s Ether

The agency has given itself until May 14 to approve or disapprove of Cboe BZX’s request to list options tied to Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), according to a March 12 SEC filing. 
Cboe BZX initially requested to list options on Fidelity’s Ether ETFs in January, the filing said.

Flurry of filings
In February, the SEC acknowledged more than a dozen exchange filings related to cryptocurrency ETFs, according to records.
The SEC’s acknowledgments highlight how the agency has softened its stance on crypto since US President Donald Trump started his second term on Jan. 20.
On March 11, Cboe BZX asked regulators for permission to incorporate staking into Fidelity’s Ether ETF. Staking is not yet permitted by any publicly traded US Ether fund. 
Staking Ether enhances returns and involves posting ETH as collateral with a validator in exchange for rewards.
Fidelity’s FETH is among the more popular Ether ETFs, with around $780 million in net assets as of March 12, according to data from VettaFi. 
In February, the SEC delayed deciding on similar rule changes proposed by Nasdaq ISE and Cboe’s affiliate, Cboe Exchange — both US-based securities exchanges. 
The agency intends to decide by April if Nasdaq can list options tied to BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). 
BlackRock’s fund is the largest ETH ETF, with more than $3.7 billion in net assets, VettaFi’s data shows.
It will rule on Cboe Exchange’s bid to list options on Fidelity’s Ether fund in May. 
Spot Ether ETFs were listed in July 2024 and have proceeded to attract nearly $7 billion in net assets, according to VettaFi’s data. 
Options are contracts granting the right to buy or sell — “call” or “put,” in trader parlance — an underlying asset at a certain price.

exhibited minor recoveries over the past 24 hours, Ether prices failed to display bullish momentum in the charts.
The altcoin plummeted to a multi-year low of $1,752 on March 11. However, onchain data and technical analysis indicate that the price could drop an additional 15% in the coming weeks.
Ethereum dips below realized price after 2 years
The current price deviation below $2,000 carried onchain implications for the altcoin. According to Glassnode, a data analytics platform, ETH dropped below its realized price of $2,054 for the first time since February 2023.

ETH realized price calculates the average price of each ETH last moved, representing the average cost basis of the total circulating supply. The current drop below the realized price indicates widespread unrealized loss for all ETH holders.
The market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio also dropped to 0.93, indicating a 7% average loss for all ETH holders across the network. However, it is important to note that the realized price reflects the weighted average of all historical transactions. Hence, it encompasses the cost basis of every ETH holder, not a specific timeframe like 2023 to 2025.

Meanwhile, Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) dropped to a six-month low of $45.6 billion on March 12, down 41% from its peak of $77 billion on Dec. 17, 2024.
Additionally, the total fees users paid to use Ethereum fell to $46.28 million—the lowest level since July 2020—further signaling weakening network engagement.

Ether price between $1.6K-$1.9K is “attractive”
In a recent X post, Glassnode explained how Ethereum’s cost-basis distribution could be useful in identifying potential support levels for ETH. Based on a weekly outlook, Ether’s recent drop below $1,880 led to an accumulation of 600,000-700,000 ETH around $1,900. The post states,
“This suggests $1.9K could establish itself as a support if $ETH consolidates at current levels. Above spot, $2.2K (465K $ETH) is the potential next resistance. The supply gap between $1.9K and $2.2K remains thin, making a short-term move towards resistance plausible.”

At the same time, anonymous analyst Ninja believes that the floor price for Ethereum remains between $1,600 and $1,900.
The trader added that the above range is an “attractive region for commercial money” and set a high swing target at $2,500.

BTC
$82,378
bounced from $76,606 on March 11, but the bulls could not sustain the price above $84,500 on March 12.
Nansen principal research analyst Aurelie Barthere told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is in a macro correction in a bull market, with the next crucial level being “$71,000-$72,000, top of the pre-election trading range.”
Glassnode also projected a similar target in its March 11 market report. The onchain analytics firm said the recent sell-off had been triggered by the short-term holders who may have purchased near the peak in January. Glassnode added that Bitcoin could bottom out near $70,000 if selling persists.

It is not only the crypto markets; even the US stock market has been under pressure in the past few days. However, a silver lining for the bulls is that the US Dollar Index (DXY) has corrected from its multi-year high above 110 to under 104. Bitcoin generally moves in inverse correlation with the dollar, suggesting that a bottom may be around the corner.
Could Bitcoin retest the support at $76,606 or rise above $85,000? What are the important support and resistance levels to watch out for in altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.
Bitcoin price analysis
Bitcoin broke below the $78,258 level on March 10 and fell to $76,606 on March 11, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests solid buying by the bulls.

The relief rally is facing selling near the 20-day exponential moving average ($87,262), but a minor positive in favor of the bulls is that the relative strength index (RSI) is showing a positive divergence. Buyers will have to drive the price above the 20-day EMA to suggest that the correction could be ending. The BTC/USDT pair may then ascend to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,654).
On the downside, the bulls are expected to defend the $73,777 level with all their might because a break below it may sink the pair to $67,000.

The bulls are trying to start a recovery, which is expected to face significant resistance at the breakdown level of $2,111. If the price turns down sharply from $2,111, it will signal that the bears have flipped the level into resistance. That heightens the risk of a break below $1,754. The ETH/USDT pair may then slump to $1,500.
Conversely, a break above the 20-day EMA ($2,235) suggests that the markets have rejected the break below $2,111. The pair may then climb to $2,800, where the bears are expected to step in.

The bears are trying to stall the recovery at the 20-day EMA ($2.35). If the price continues lower, the possibility of a break below $2 increases. If that happens, the XRP/USDT pair will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. There is minor support at $1.77, but if the level cracks, the decline could extend to $1.28.
Contrary to this assumption, if the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($2.58) and later to $3.

The relief rally is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($592). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to sink the BNB/USDT pair below $500. The pair may drop to $460 if they can pull it off.
Instead, if the price rises above the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the pair may remain inside the $460 to $745 range for a while longer. The bulls will be back in the driver’s seat on a break and close above the 50-day SMA ($628).
Solana price analysis

The RSI shows early signs of forming a positive divergence, indicating that the bearish momentum could weaken. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA ($145). 
If the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA, it suggests that every minor rally is being sold into. That increases the risk of a break below $110. The SOL/USDT pair could tumble to $98 and subsequently to $80.
Cardano price analysis

The bears are unlikely to give up easily and are expected to sell at the moving averages. If the price turns down from the moving averages, it will signal selling on rallies. The bears will then try to strengthen their position by pulling the price below the uptrend line. If they do that, the ADA/USDT pair could drop to $0.60 and then to $0.50.
Contrary to this assumption, a break and close above the moving averages suggests that the bulls are back in the game. The pair may then rally to $1.02.

If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA ($0.20), it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. That increases the risk of a break below $0.14. The DOGE/USDT pair may descend to $0.10 if that happens.

On the contrary, a break and close above the 20-day EMA suggests that the bears are losing their grip. The pair could climb to the 50-day SMA ($0.25), which may pose a solid challenge again.
Pi price analysis
Pi (PI) is taking support at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $1.20, indicating buying at lower levels.

The relief rally is expected to face resistance at the 20-day EMA ($1.69) and then again at $2. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the PI/USDT pair could range between $2 and $1.20 for some time.
A break and close above $2 suggests that the correction may be over. The pair could rally to $2.40. Alternatively, a break and close below $1.20 could sink the pair to the 78.6% retracement level of $0.72.

The LEO/USD pair has formed an ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $10. If that happens, the pair could resume the uptrend toward the target objective of $12.04.
This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the uptrend line. That will negate the bullish setup, starting a drop to $8.84 and later to $8.30.

The recovery is facing selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.22), as seen from the long wick on the candlestick. If the price continues lower, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the HBAR/USDT pair below $0.17. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to $0.12.
Contrarily, a break above the 20-day EMA suggests that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair could rise to the downtrend line, which is an important level to watch out for. If buyers push the price above the downtrend line, the pair could rally to $0.29.

BTC price reverses at key bull market trendline
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching three-day highs of $84,437 on Bitstamp before reversing.
The January print of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in below expectations at 2.8%, per data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), hinting at slowing inflation.
“Core CPI inflation FALLS to 3.1%, below expectations of 3.2%,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter added in part of a response on X. 
“This marks the first decline in both Headline and Core CPI since July 2024. Inflation is cooling down in the US.”

However, the good news was short-lived as the start of Wall Street trading saw the return of characteristic selling pressure across crypto markets.

Bitcoin thus fell to $82,400 before consolidating, at the time of writing, circling the daily open.
In his latest market observations, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital saw reason for cautious optimism on BTC price performance.
“The latest Bitcoin Daily Close means that price has began the process of exiting its recently filled CME Gap after turning it into support,” he told X followers, referring to the difference between session closing and opening levels on CME Group’s Bitcoin futures — a common short-term price influence.
“Any dips into the top of the CME Gap would constitute a post-breakout retest attempt to fully confirm the exit from this CME Gap. Initial signs of that retest occurring already.”

Fellow trader Daan Crypto Trades focused on the 200-day simple and exponential moving averages (SMA/EMA) — classic bull market support trendlines currently at $83,550 and $85,650, respectively.
“Bulls got work to do here to get back above the Daily 200MA/EMA. Last year we had the same thing and price chopped around these levels for 3+ months,” part of his latest X analysis noted.

Bitcoin ETF outflows point to “growing caution”
Continuing on the macro theme, trading firm QCP Capital suggested that the day’s CPI print could weigh on the Federal Reserve’s interest rates decision next week.

“With inflation concerns lingering and macro risks mounting, the CPI print will be a key determinant of whether the disinflationary trend will hold, or volatility intensifies in the near term,” it wrote in its latest “Asia Color” market update.
QCP saw $82,000 solidifying as support, while institutional investor trends warranted caution.
“Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs saw a significant net outflow of $153.87 million, led by Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which recently offloaded 641 BTC, valued at $56.45 million,” it concluded, referencing netflows from the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 
“This brought GBTC’s total holdings down to 195,746 BTC, worth around $17.24 billion. This signals growing caution among institutional investors.”

Let’s examine the key drivers behind XRP’s rebound today.
Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF filing
One of the primary catalysts behind today’s XRP price surge is Franklin Templeton’s filing of an XRP ETF in the United States.
🔥 JUST IN: Franklin XRP Trust Files S-1 With the SEC for an XRP ETF on Cboe BZX. pic.twitter.com/B6oo3e5k0d
— Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 11, 2025
Key takeaways:
On March 11, California-based asset manager Franklin Templeton filed an S-1 registration form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot XRP ETF. 
Franklin Templeton is a major global asset manager with $1.5 trillion in assets under management.
It joins a growing list of financial giants like Bitwise, Grayscale, and WisdomTree in pursuing XRP-based ETFs. 
This filing signals a strong vote of confidence in XRP’s potential as a mainstream investment vehicle.
The news has fueled speculation of major capital inflows that could push XRP price into double digits. 
“Franklin Templeton has filed the 17th XRP ETF, which alone has $1.53 trillion USD under their asset management,” said pseudonymous XRP analyst Dark Defender in a March 12 post on X.
“Just imagine when all are approved. Double digits for XRP will be as easy as a pie.”
Meanwhile, the odds of a US spot XRP ETF being approved in 2025 are now at 76% on Polymarket.

If approved, it would boost XRP’s credibility and could draw billions of dollars in capital inflows, according to JP Morgan. 
Despite the SEC delaying decisions on other XRP ETF applications, such as those from Grayscale and Canary Capital, until May 2025, Franklin Templeton’s entry—given its size and reputation—has boosted market confidence, contributing to XRP’s price rebound.
MVRV metric suggests XRP price bottom
Beyond external catalysts, onchain data provides a compelling case for XRP’s price recovery. 
Key points:
Metrics like the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio indicate that XRP may have bottomed.
The MVRV ratio compares XRP’s market cap to the value of coins at their last transaction, offering insight into whether the asset is overbought or oversold.
Data from Santiment shows XRP’s 30-day MVRV ratio has plunged to a low of -16%, the lowest since April 2024.

The chart above shows it inside a zone typically associated with accumulation, suggesting that selling pressure has subsided.
Historically, XRP usually experiences a reversal whenever the 30D MVRV declines below 10%.
XRP price eyes V-shaped recovery to $2.64
XRP’s price action has been nurturing a V-shaped recovery chart pattern on the four-hour chart since March 6, as shown below.
A V-shaped recovery is a bullish pattern formed when an asset experiences a sharp price increase after a steep decline. 
XRP appears to be on a similar trajectory and now trades below a key supply congestion zone between $2.30 and $2.45, where all the major simple moving averages (SMAs) are currently sitting.
The bulls must now push XRP above this area to increase the chances of the price rising to the neckline at $2.64 to complete the V-pattern.
Completing the V-shaped recovery would result in 20% gains from the current price.

The relative strength index has risen from oversold conditions at 27 on March 10 to 44 on March 1, suggesting that bullish momentum is picking up.

Ether risks correction to $1,800 amid tariff fears, ETF outflows
Ether’s price has fallen by more than 53% since it began its downtrend on Dec. 16, 2024, after it had peaked above $4,100.

The main reasons behind Ether’s downtrend are the ongoing macroeconomic concerns and lack of builder activity on the Ethereum network, according to Bitfinex analysts.
“A lack of new projects or builders moving to ETH, primarily due to high operating fees, is likely the principal reason behind the lackluster performance of ETH. [...] We believe that for ETH, $1,800 will be a strong level to watch,” the analysts told Cointelegraph.

“However, the current sell-off is not being seen solely in ETH, we have seen a marketwide correction as fears over the impact of tariffs hit all risk assets,” they added.

XRP ETF: Here are the funds awaiting SEC approval so far,https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-etf-filings-awaiting-sec-approval,2025-03-12,"American asset manager Franklin Templeton has entered the growing XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) race, becoming the latest firm to file for a spot XRP ETF in the United States.
Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF is designed to track the performance of the XRP price, with XRP holdings stored at Coinbase Custody Trust, according to an official filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on March 11.
On the same day, the SEC postponed decisions on multiple crypto ETF filings, including Grayscale’s proposal to convert its XRP Trust into an ETF.
Despite the growing XRP ETF filing frenzy, BlackRock — issuer of the largest spot Bitcoin ETF — has yet to submit a filing for an XRP-based product.
Who has filed for an XRP ETF in the US?
As of March 12, nine companies have filed for XRP ETF products in the US, including major issuers like Bitwise, ProShares, 21Shares and others.
Bitwise, one of the world’s largest crypto funds managers, was the first firm to submit a Form S-1 filing for an XRP ETF on Oct. 2, 2024.

Canary Capital subsequently followed, filing a Form S-1 for a similar product on Oct. 8, 2024.
Switzerland-based crypto investment firm 21Shares and US ETF provider WisdomTree also filed for XRP ETFs in late 2024, with filings coming in November and December, respectively.
Asset manager ProShares joined the XRP ETF race in 2025 by filing for several XRP ETF products with the SEC on Jan. 17, including the ProShares XRP ETF and three additional XRP investment products.

Another XRP ETF filing came from the European crypto investment firm CoinShares in January, with Grayscale proposing to convert its XRP Trust into an XRP ETF trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 30.
Volatility Shares, a Florida-based financial services firm founded in 2019, also filed three XRP ETF products on March 7, including the Volatility Shares XRP ETF, the Volatility Shares 2x XRP ETF and the Volatility Shares -1x XRP ETF.
Other filings featuring XRP ETFs
Beyond dedicated XRP ETF filings, at least two asset managers have included XRP in broader crypto ETF products.
On Jan. 21, asset manager REX-Osprey filed for an “ETF Opportunities Trust,” which includes seven ETFs tracking assets including major coins such as XRP and Bitcoin, as well as memecoins like Bonk and Official Trump (TRUMP).
Similarly, Tuttle Capital Management submitted an ETF opportunities trust filing, including 10 daily target ETFs, covering assets such as XRP and Melania (MELANIA).

Bitcoin’s next catalyst: End of $36T US debt ceiling suspension,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-catalyst-end-of-36-t-us-debt-ceiling-suspension,2025-03-12,"Bitcoin’s next significant price catalyst may arrive Friday as the US debt suspension period comes to an end, potentially injecting fresh liquidity into markets and driving a price rebound.
The US Treasury hit its $36 trillion debt ceiling a day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. A “debt issuance suspension period” began then and was set to last until March 14, according to a letter published on Jan. 17.

has dropped 22% during the two-month debt suspension plan, from over $106,000 on Jan. 21 to $82,535 at the time of writing on March 12, TradingView data shows.

A resumption of government spending may bring a liquidity boost to catalyze Bitcoin’s next rally, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
“With in-hand cash, the demand for financial assets such as stocks and crypto can increase, and there may be a relief from ongoing volatility,” the analyst told Cointelegraph. “In such periods, we can expect a boost in the overall momentum, although many other factors are important to note.”
Beyond global tariff uncertainty, “concerns such as inflation, interest rates and geopolitical issues remain unresolved,” Lee added.
Considering that the debt suspension will end just two weeks after the White House Crypto Summit, a portion of the new liquidity may flow into cryptocurrencies, according to Aleksei Ponomarev, co-founder and CEO of crypto index investing firm J’JO.
“Surges in liquidity have typically benefited Bitcoin and risk assets, and the end of the US debt suspension will be no different,” he told Cointelegraph, adding:
“While the liquidity surge will undoubtedly drive market price movement, it is limited to short-term impact. The long-term trajectory of Bitcoin is, and remains, tied to institutional investments, ETF growth and regulatory clarity and implementation.”

Bitcoin’s right-hand side (RHS), which marks the lowest bid price for which someone is willing to sell the currency, may still face a potential correction to near $70,000 until the end of the debt suspension period on Friday, based on its correlation with the global liquidity index.
Still, the growing money supply could push Bitcoin price above $132,000 before the end of 2025, according to estimates from Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Real Vision.

Bitcoin price still limited by global trade war concerns
While more global liquidity is an optimistic sign for Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency remains limited by global trade tariff concerns, according to James Wo, the founder and CEO of venture capital firm DFG:
“While some may argue that retaliatory measures from tariff-imposed countries were already priced in, tariffs have a delayed economic impact beyond their initial announcement.”
“Higher import costs and reduced corporate margins are likely to push inflation higher, forcing central banks to keep interest rates elevated for longer under a restrictive monetary policy,” he added.
This may also tighten liquidity conditions, making risk assets such as Bitcoin “less attractive in the short to medium term,” Wo said.
Related: Bitcoin reserve backlash signals unrealistic industry expectations
The European Union introduced retaliatory tariffs on March 12, threatening a Bitcoin correction below $75,000 in the short term. This may occur temporarily due to Europe accounting for over $1.5 trillion of annual US exports.
Despite the short-term correction concerns, most analysts remained optimistic about Bitcoin’s price trajectory for late 2025, with price predictions ranging from $160,000 to above $180,000.

Demand for Bitcoin remains weak
Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) outflows have played a big role in the BTC price drop since late February, surpassing $1.5 billion over the last two weeks.
Related: Why is Bitcoin price up today?
Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s apparent demand remains low, implying a decline in risk appetite from potential investors, according to data from market intelligence firm CryptoQuant, 
What to know:
Apparent demand is the difference between production and changes in inventory. 
Production refers to BTC mining issuance, while inventory refers to inactive supply for over a year.
Apparent demand weakens if production exceeds inventory reduction.
After a period of acceleration between November 2024 and December 2024, fueled by President Donald Trump’s victory, Bitcoin apparent demand dropped from 279,000 BTC on Dec. 4 to 10,000 on Feb. 26.
On Feb. 27, the metric turned negative for the first time since September 2024.
It currently stands at -93,700 BTC at the time of writing. 
If the trend continues, the price could dip lower, just as it happened in July 2024.
The chart below shows that Bitcoin apparent demand was at similar levels on July 27, 2024, after which BTC price dropped a further 30% to $49,000 on Aug. 5, 2024.

However, this metric does not always guarantee more downside in the future. For example, it was also negative in late May 2024 and late October 2024 before the price rallied 7% and 73%, respectively.
Bitcoin valuation metrics hint at deeper correction 
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView show Bitcoin price trading 7% above its four-month low of $76,600 reached on March 12.
Despite this rebound, several valuation metrics are still leaning bearish, suggesting a deeper correction is possible, according to CryptoQuant.
The Bitcoin bull-bear market cycle Indicator is at its “most bearish level"" of this cycle.
The bull/bear market cycle indicator is a momentum metric that measures the difference between the P&L Index and its 365-day moving average.
Values above 0 show that BTC is in a bull market, while values below 0 indicate a bear market.
The current value of -0.067 is at the lowest level since May 2023, when Bitcoin’s price embarked on a sustained recovery.

Meanwhile, the MVRV ratio Z-score has crossed below its 365-day moving average, indicating that the upward price trend has lost momentum.
The MVRV ratio Z-score is a key metric used to assess whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. 
“Historically, valuation metrics at these levels have signaled either a sharp correction or the start of a bear market.”
Bitcoin price bear flag hints at $68,400
From a technical perspective, BTC price is trading within a bearish continuation pattern that indicates a potential correction ahead.
Key points:
BTC is trading within a bear flag pattern, indicating the possibility of more downside if key support levels don’t hold.
The bear flag developed after Bitcoin dropped from $92,000 to a local low of $76,600 between March 6 and 11.
The consolidation within the bear flag has BTC trading in an ascending parallel channel, with today’s drop testing critical support levels, including the lower boundary of the flag at $82,000.
BTC/USD four-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
A breakdown of this level could trigger another price crash.
The bear flag’s downside target, derived from the height of the previous drop, is approximately $68,400, representing a 17% drop from the current price.
CryptoQuant analysts, meanwhile, say that if the current support zone between $75,000 and $78,000 doesn’t hold, Bitcoin could go even lower to $63,000.

at $80,000 is proving attractive for large-volume investors, or at least a poor value selling proposition for those wishing to exit the market.
In a “Quicktake” blog post on March 12, CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost revealed that the proportion of the top 10 largest inflows to Binance attributed to whales has declined.
“Monitoring whale behavior has consistently provided valuable insights into potential market movements,” they summarized. 
“Given that Binance handles the highest volumes, analyzing the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio on Binance provides a good insight into broader whale activity.”

The exchange’s whale ratio has, in fact, exhibited a broad downtrend since mid-January when BTC/USD hit its latest all-time highs.
“Currently, this ratio is declining, implying that Binance’s whales are reducing their selling pressure,” the post continued. 
“Historically, an increasing ratio has been associated with short-term price corrections or consolidation phases, while a decreasing ratio has often preceded bullish trends. If this trend of diminishing selling pressure continues, it could help end the current correction and potentially signal a market rebound.”

As Cointelegraph reported, both whales and larger entities holding at least 10 BTC have begun to accumulate coins this month, albeit at modest rates.
Prospective BTC buyers “hesitant” at $80,000
Overall appetite for BTC exposure nonetheless remains suppressed.

In the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Week Onchain,” analytics firm Glassnode pointed to lackluster demand at current prices.
It referenced capital flows by short-term holders (STHs) — speculative entities holding coins for up to six months. Within this cohort, buyers holding between one week and one month now have a lower cost basis than those holding for between one and three months.
“With Bitcoin prices dropping below $95k, this model also confirmed a transition into net capital outflows, as the 1w–1m cost basis fell below the 1m–3m cost basis,” the researchers explained. 
“This reversal indicates that macro uncertainty has spooked demand, reducing new inflows and arguably increasing the probability of further sell pressure and a prolonged correction. This transition suggests that new buyers are now hesitant to absorb sell-side pressure, reinforcing the shift from post-ATH euphoria into a more cautious market environment.”

is up 5% over the past 24 hours, rallying from a new local low at $76,450 to a high of $83,786 on March 12.
On the weekly chart, BTC’s price retested its 50-weekly exponential moving average, or 50W-EMA indicator (blue line), as support.

As observed in the chart, Bitcoin’s price has maintained a position above this indicator since August 2023, which is a long-term bullish position. The 50-EMA level has been a support level for Bitcoin over the last 18 months.
Previously, Bitcoin bounced off this trendline in September 2024 before continuing to new all-time highs.
Bitcoin shows multiple bullish divergences
Before its relief rally, Bitcoin’s low time frame (LTF) and high time frame (HTF) charts displayed bullish divergences between price and the relative strength index (RSI) indicator.
Bullish divergences occur when the price and RSI move in opposite directions, with the price making a lower low and the RSI forming a higher low. Such technical setups indicate that underlying bullish momentum is improving to possibly reverse the dominant bearish trend.

As illustrated in the chart, bullish divergences appeared on the 15-minute, 1-hour, 4-hour, and 1-day charts, which improved the probability of a short-term rebound.
Meanwhile, the RSI created a higher low on each chart after the indicator dropped below the 30 level, which is the oversold region. The oversold region hints at declining sell pressure, with buyers potentially stepping in to reverse the trend.

A bullish divergence on the daily chart is also a rare event. Since 2020, BTC has exhibited a similar technical setup only six times (including the current one), signaling a bottom on each occasion. The last divergence took place between July and August 2024.

Likewise, Bitcoin’s recent sweep below its previous lows at $78,150 collected all the existing liquidity on the downside. This helped BTC price to rebound above the $80,000 mark.
According to the liquidation heatmap, BTC has cleared downside liquidity, leaving over $250 million in leveraged positions on the upside, specifically between $85,000 and $87,000. Thus, Bitcoin might rally toward this range in the next few days.

Bitcoin inverse head and shoulder eyes $88K
On the one-hour chart, Bitcoin’s price has formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern over the past few days, hinting at confirmation if a candle closes above the neckline of $83,800.

Bitcoin could retest a higher price range if it decisively breaks above the neckline. The pattern target suggests a 7% upswing from the neckline, pushing Bitcoin to $89,000.
This target aligns with the Fibonacci retracement levels, namely the 0.50 and 0.618 Fibs. These levels are Bitcoin’s recent lower high of $96,450 and lower low of $76,560.

However, the bullish pattern will undergo invalidation if the BTC value drops under $78,500. A drop below that level would invalidate the current higher-high bullish setup on the lower time frame.
RektProof provided a similar insight, with the crypto analyst expecting the price to consolidate near overhead resistance between $86,000 and $88,000. However, due to a strong demand zone near $74,000 to $70,000, the trader expects the price to eventually drop and form new price lows in the coming days or weeks.

"Bitcoin high-entry buyers are driving sell pressure, price may ‘floor’ at $70K",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-high-entry-buyers-sell-pressure-btc-retrace-possible,2025-03-12,"Bitcoin buyers who purchased around when it hit a $109,000 all-time peak in January are now panic-selling as the cryptocurrency declines, says onchain analytics firm Glassnode, which isn’t ruling out that Bitcoin could slide to $70,000.
Glassnode said in a March 11 markets report that a recent sell-off by top buyers has driven “intense loss realization and a moderate capitulation event.”

in recent months is reflected in the short-term holder realized price — the average purchase price for those holding Bitcoin for less than 155 days.
In October, the short-term realized price was $62,000. At the time of publication, it’s $91,362 — up about 47% in five months, according to Bitbo data.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading at $81,930 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap. This leaves the average short-term holder with an unrealized loss of roughly 10.6%.

Glassnode said that short-term holders’ realized price shows it is apparent that “market momentum and capital flows have turned negative, signaling a decline in demand strength.” 
“Investor uncertainty is affecting sentiment and confidence,” it added.
Glassnode said that short-term holders are “deeply underwater” between $71,300 and $91,900 and warns that Bitcoin could bottom out as low as $70,000 if selling persists.
“The probability of forming a temporary floor in this zone is meaningful, at least in the near term,” Glassnode said.

Market research firm 10x Research labeled it a “textbook correction” in a March 10 note, adding that with Bitcoin’s dip below $80,000, “approximately 70% of all selling came from investors who bought within the last three months.”

On the same day, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said that Bitcoin may retest the $78,000 price level and, if that fails, may head to $75,000 next.
Glassnode explained that a similar sell-off Bitcoin pattern was seen in August when Bitcoin fell from $68,000 to around $49,000 amid fears of a recession, poor employment data in the United States, and sluggish growth among leading tech stocks.
However, Bitcoin has spiked 7.5% over the past 24 hours as the US market steaded on March 11 after plunging a day earlier after US President Donald Trump refused to rule out that a recession was on the cards.

Bitcoin jumps 7% despite metrics flashing ‘bearish territory’,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-spike-valuation-metrics-bearish-crypto-analyst,2025-03-12,"Bitcoin has clocked a 7% gain over the past 24 hours despite all of its valuation metrics leaning bearish and US demand recently waning off.
“All Bitcoin valuation metrics indicate that we are in bearish territory,” onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant said in a March 11 markets report viewed by Cointelegraph. 
Demand falling at “fastest pace” since July
CryptoQuant said its Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator is at its “most bearish level’ of this cycle, and Bitcoin’s MVRV Ratio Z-score — a key metric to assess whether Bitcoin
BTC
$82,455
is overvalued or undervalued — has crossed the 365-day moving average, “indicating that the upward price trend has lost momentum.”
At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $82,910, up from a 24-hour low of $79,356, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Bitcoin has spiked 7.5% over the past 24 hours as the US market steaded on March 11 after plunging a day earlier after US President Donald Trump refused to rule out that a recession was on the cards.
Most of Bitcoin’s gains followed Senator Cynthia Lummis’ reintroduction of the BITCOIN Act, which proposes that the US government buy 1 million BTC over five years.

However, some traders are not convinced that the downtrend is over.
Crypto analyst Bitcoin Rachy said in a March 11 X post, “Fake pump, right?” Similarly, crypto trader BitcoinHyper said in an X post, “Every pump feels like the beginning. This is how the market takes your money.”
Meanwhile, CryptoQuant said that Bitcoin’s demand fell by 103,000 BTC last week compared to the previous week, “marking its fastest pace of contraction since July 2024.” 
Bitcoin demand in “contradiction territory”
CryptoQuant said the reason for the decline in Bitcoin’s demand in the US recently was due to uncertainty around US inflation rates and US President Donald Trump’s imposed tariffs on Feb. 1. On March 7, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell reiterated that he was in no hurry to adjust interest rates.
“Bitcoin demand remains in contraction territory, whales have slowed down their Bitcoin accumulation, and spot ETFs in the US have turned into net sellers of Bitcoin,” the firm said.
Related: 4 signs that $76.7K Bitcoin is probably the ultimate low
Bitcoin is still down 14% over the past month, and CryptoQuant says the drawdown is not “unusual in terms of magnitude, as similar corrections have occurred in past bull markets.”
However, it warned if Bitcoin that breaks its current support at the $75,000 to $78,000 price level, its next target could be as low as $63,000, a level not seen since Oct. 14.
Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten recently told Cointelegraph his forecast is that “there’s more than 50% chance we will see all-time highs before the end of June this year.” Bitcoin’s current all-time high of $109,000 was reached on Jan. 20.

4 signs that $76.7K Bitcoin is probably the ultimate low,https://cointelegraph.com/news/4-reasons-why-76-7k-bitcoin-btc-is-the-ultimate-low,2025-03-12,"Bitcoin dropped to a four-month low of $76,700 on March 11, following a 6% weekly decline in the S&P 500 index.
The stock market correction pushed the index to its lowest level in six months as investors priced in higher odds of a global economic downturn.
Despite Bitcoin's 30% drop from its all-time high of $109,350, four key indicators suggest that the correction may be over.
Bitcoin bear market needs 40% drop, strong USD
Some analysts argue that Bitcoin has entered a bear market. However, the current price action differs significantly from the November 2021 crash, which started with a 41% drop from $69,000 to $40,560 in just 60 days.
A comparable scenario today would imply a decline to $64,400 by the end of March.

The current correction mirrors the 31.5% drop from $71,940 on June 7, 2024, to $49,220 over 60 days.
Additionally, during the late 2021 bear market, the US dollar was strengthening against a basket of foreign currencies, as reflected in the DXY index, which surged from 92.4 in September 2021 to 96.0 by December 2021.
DXY (left, blue) vs. BTC/USD (right). Nov. 2021 vs. Feb. 2025. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph
This time, however, the DXY started 2025 at 109.2 and has since declined to 104. Traders argue that Bitcoin maintains an inverse correlation with the DXY index, as it is primarily viewed as a risk-on asset rather than a safe-haven hedge against dollar weakness.
Overall, current market conditions show no signs of investors moving to cash positions, which supports Bitcoin’s price.
BTC derivatives healthy as investors fear AI bubble
The Bitcoin derivatives market remains stable, as the current annualized premium on futures stands at 4.5%, despite a 19% price drop between March 2 and 11.
For comparison, on June 18, 2022, this indicator fell below 0% after a sharp 44% decline from $31,350 to $17,585 in just 12 days.

Similarly, the Bitcoin perpetual futures funding rate is hovering near zero, signaling balanced leverage demand between longs and shorts. Bearish market conditions typically drive excessive demand for short positions, pushing the funding rate below zero.
Several publicly traded companies with market values exceeding $150 billion have seen sharp declines from their all-time highs, including Tesla (-54%), Palantir (-40%), Nvidia (-34%), Blackstone (-32%), Broadcom (-29%), TSM (-26%), and ServiceNow (-25%). Investor sentiment, especially in the artificial intelligence sector, has turned bearish amid growing recession fears.

Traders are concerned about a potential US government shutdown on March 15, as lawmakers must pass a bill to raise the debt ceiling. However, according to Yahoo Finance, the Republican party remains divided.
The key points of contention in House Speaker Mike Johnson’s proposal are increased spending on defense and immigration.
Risk-on markets, including Bitcoin, are likely to react positively if an agreement is reached.
Real estate crisis is not necessarily negative
Early signs of a real estate crisis could accelerate capital outflows into other scarce assets. According to Feb. 27 data from the US National Association of Realtors, home contract signings fell to an all-time low in January.
Additionally, a Feb. 23 opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal revealed that over 7% of Federal Housing Administration-insured loans are at least 90 days past due, surpassing the peak of the 2008 subprime crisis.
In essence, Bitcoin's path to reclaiming $90,000 is supported by a weaker US dollar, historical evidence that a 30% price correction does not signal a bear market, resilience in BTC derivatives markets, contagion from government shutdown risks, and early signs of a real estate crisis.

Bitcoin, stocks deflate on fresh tariffs letdown
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView followed BTC/USD as it touched local highs of $82,154 on Bitstamp before consolidating.
US JOLTS job openings data delivered a slight overshoot versus expectations, but it was confirmation of further trade tariffs on Canada by US President Donald Trump that spoiled risk-asset relief.
The S&P 500 thus traded down 0.5% on the day at the time of writing, while stock indexes continued to see volatility.
“The S&P 500 was up +5% at this point in Trump’s first term. Instead, it’s now down -7% since January 20th,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter observed in part of a reaction on X. 
“A polar opposite start to his term so far.”

Trading firm QCP Capital added that Trump’s apparent “indifference to recession risks” made life harder for risk assets but acknowledged that some silver linings remained.
“Despite the market turmoil, not all signals are bearish,” it summarized in its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers. 
“This wave of risk-off sentiment has driven 10-year Treasury yields down by around 60 bps and weakened the US dollar — a historically positive factor for USD-denominated risk assets like US equities and crypto.”

The US dollar index (DXY) dropped to 103.32 on the day, marking its lowest level since mid-October 2024.
New BTC price lows still “possible”
Bitcoin price analysis meanwhile saw BTC/USD at a crossroads amid a lack of clear upside catalysts.

Trading channel More Crypto Online used Elliott Wave theory to delineate key support and resistance levels, warning that price could still head to new long-term lows.
“The price is still undecided after the New York open. A bottom could be forming here, but another low is possible as long as resistance holds,” it told X followers. 
“A confirmed low needs a sustained break above yesterday’s high in 5 waves. The market, as always, enjoys keeping traders guessing.”

Popular trader CrypNuevo meanwhile described a “great reaction” at the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) at around $75,500.

On the high time frame (HTF) charts, XRP must hold above its psychological level at $2, but other metrics suggest that a deeper drawdown is possible.
XRP markets lack buyers as futures flip bearish
XRP price is currently down 37.1% from its all-time high of $3.40. When prices dipped by a similar percentage on Feb. 3, spot market bids quickly absorbed the selling pressure, pushing XRP above $2.50.
XRP’s spot and perpetual aggregated data. Source: aggr.trade
However, XRP‘s spot and perpetual markets were relatively bearish over the past week. Data from aggr.trade indicates that XRP’s spot cumulative volume delta (CVD) dropped by 50% in March.
A negative CVD means that there is more selling volume than buying. The current CVD value is -$408 million, which signals waning demand, with sellers taking control.
Likewise, futures traders are also turning bearish, with perpetual CVD dropping to -1.18 billion on March 11. XRP’s open interest-weighted funding rate has also turned significantly negative, which indicates more short positions were added over the past few days.

XRP whales continue selling spree
XRP’s volume bubble map showed a surge in activity toward the end of February. Ki-Young Ju, CryptoQuant founder, observed that this uptick aligned with an ongoing distribution phase for XRP.
Distribution refers to a period in the market cycle when large investors slowly offload their positions to secure gains, usually happening close to the peak of an upward trend.
Related: Why is the XRP price down today?
Current data reveals that the distribution phase has intensified over the past seven days. Specifically, whale outflows, measured as a 30-day moving average, have steadily risen.
This increase suggests that large holders continued to offload their XRP positions, further driving the distribution trend.

Between March 4 and March 10, these large XRP holders offloaded roughly $838 million in positions. This significant sell-off reflects the ongoing bearish trend for XRP.
XRP price H&S pattern hints at $1.60 retest
On March 11, XRP’s 1-day chart closed below $2.05, which is the critical neckline of the daily head-and-shoulders pattern. This pattern has potentially strong bearish consequences when observed on a high time frame (HTF) chart.
XRP 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
Lower prices are likely if XRP fails to reclaim $2.05 as support, as illustrated in the chart above.
The immediate target zone for the XRP price remains between 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement lines. Also known as the “golden zone,” the retest range lies between $1.90 and $1.60. The likelihood of retesting the 0.618 Fibonacci or $1.60 is high in the current bearish environment.
Failure to hold this range could lead to a retest of the long-term demand zone between $1.58 and $1.27.

Dogecoin’s bearishness on March 11 is accompanied by significant liquidations in the derivatives market, signaling strong bearish pressure.

Moving averages are not in Dogecoin’s favor
The ongoing drawdown comes after DOGE ran into a major resistance zone.
Notably:
A key barrier sits between $0.24 and $0.26, within which the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $0.247 and the 50-day SMA at $0.257 are currently. 
Since Feb. 3, DOGE bulls have attempted to rise above this level three times, but on each occasion, the altcoin produced a lower high than the previous one. 
This means that traders sell every time the price tries to cross this zone.
An additional barrier sits higher up at $0.3129, which is also the 100-day SMA.

On the downside, a key area of interest lies between the psychological level at $0.150 and the range low at $0.127, reached on Oct. 26, 2024.
This is an important level that bulls need to defend in order to avoid further losses to $0.10.
Note that when the DOGE bounced off this level in November 2024, it initiated a 227% rally to $0.480.

Several factors appear to be contributing to ETH price losses, including:
US recession fears and its overall impact on risk-on markets.
Massive long liquidations in the crypto market.
Crypto loans backed by ETH as collateral facing liquidation risks.
Bearish technicals.
Ether price declines with risk-on assets
Ether’s ongoing price drop mirrors similar declines in the broader risk-on market due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions.
Key points:
The crypto market’s combined market capitalization has dropped by over 4.6% in the last 24 hours, aligning with selloffs in US stocks.

JPMorgan raised US recession risk to 40% for 2025, up from 30%, citing US President Donald Trump’s ""extreme US policies"" as a key risk factor.
Goldman Sachs also raised its 12-month recession probability to 20%, up from 15%.
Earlier in March, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on all goods from Mexico and Canada, and 10% tariffs on Chinese imports.
Canada and Mexico have announced intentions to impose retaliatory tariffs on US goods, escalating trade tensions and raising concerns about a potential trade war.
Meanwhile, China has already retaliated by increasing tariffs on multiple US products and imposing export controls and investment restrictions on 25 US firms.
These tariffs are expected to increase consumer prices and contribute to US inflation.
US recession fears are impacting Ethereum and the crypto sector, notably:
Ether, Bitcoin, and other top-ranking crypto assets have historically declined during periods of economic turbulences, e.g., the Covid-19 sell-off in March 2020.
As of March 11, the 52-week correlation between the crypto market and the US benchmark index, the S&P 500 index, was 0.69.

The rate cut pause scenario dampens the crypto and ETH risk appetite.
Bad DeFi loans increase Ether sell-off pressure
A $74 million DeFi loan on the Sky protocol, collateralized with $130 million in ETH, almost got liquidated after Ether price fell below the liquidation level just above $1,900.
As it happened:
The borrower added $34 million in ETH as collateral to avoid liquidation.
Withdrew $1.6 million in USDT from Binance, swapped it for DAI, and deposited into Maker.
Reduced debt to $73.1 million while ETH’s price continued to decline.
Liquidation level remained at $1,836 per ETH, closer to ETH’s current price above $1,900.
Nearly $353 million in debt is tied to such loans, risking liquidation if ETH’s price falls 20% from here.

Such a cascade of liquidations could exacerbate the downward pressure as borrowers scramble to stabilize their positions by selling or moving ETH.
Long liquidations accelerate ETH downtrend
Ether’s tumble over the past 24 hours coincided with a wave of long liquidations that forced traders to exit their leveraged positions.
Key takeaways:
Over $240 million worth of ETH positions were wiped out in the last 24 hours, with long liquidations accounting for $196.27 million, or 82% of the total.

The sharp price drop triggered a cascade of forced sell-offs as traders betting on Ethereum’s price increase were liquidated.
When leveraged long positions fail to maintain margin requirements, exchanges automatically sell off their holdings to cover losses.
Such liquidations accelerate price declines, exacerbating the downturn.
The broader crypto market also experienced a sharp deleveraging event, with total liquidations reaching $897.26 million across assets.

Ether eyes further decline toward $1,700
From a technical perspective, Ether’s price decline today is part of its prevailing inverse-cup-and-handle (IC&H) pattern.
Key points:
The rounded top formation (cup) suggests a loss of bullish momentum, with sellers gradually taking control.
ETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView
A temporary consolidation (handle) formed near $2,700, indicating a failed breakout attempt.
ETH broke below key support levels, confirming the IC&H breakdown, leading to more losses.
The measured move target from the pattern suggests a potential decline toward $1,700, aligning with the dotted support level.
The 50-day EMA ($2,600) and 200-day EMA ($2,929) remain far above, reinforcing bearish sentiment.
Key levels to watch:
ETH price is inside a descending channel pattern since late February.
As of March 11, the ETH/USD pair was rising after testing the channel’s lower trendline as support.

Such rebounds have taken prices toward the channel’s upper trendline in recent history.
If the fractal repeats, ETH’s next upside target could be around $2,000, aligning with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement line.
A reversal from current price levels could have ETH test the IC&H downside target of $1,700.

Why is Cardano price down today?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-cardano-price-down-today,2025-03-11,"Cardano
ADA
$0.712
price displays weakness on March 11, down 2.5% over the last 24 hours to trade at $0.7250. A weakening technical setup and several onchain signals suggest that ADA could see a deeper correction in the coming days.
ADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
Let’s take a closer look at why ADA price is underperforming today.
ADA falls alongside Bitcoin and Ether
The bearish sentiment was not only exclusive to Cardano as crypto prices also plummeted across the board, with Bitcoin dropping toward $76,000 on March 10.
Key takeaways:
Market leader Bitcoin
BTC
$82,435
has shed over 3.6% and 17% over the last week and month, respectively, setting a new four-month low of around $76,600 on March 10. 
BTC price has since recovered above $81,000 but is still down 1.3% over the last 24 hours.
Ether
ETH
$1,898
has also dropped by 8.6% over the last 24 hours to trade below $2,000 for the first time since November 2023.

This dragged altcoins like ADA down even more, with a 41% decline over the last 90 days compared to BTC’s 19% decline over the same period. 
The ADA/BTC pair is down approximately 20% over the same time frame.
The crypto market’s volatility has been exacerbated by macroeconomic uncertainty, which has also seen a sharp drop in US equities, with crypto-related stocks such as Strategy (MSTR) and Coinbase (COIN) tanking 10%.
Lack of near-term positive catalysts, a potential tariff war and fears of a US recession are adding headwinds to an already battered market.
Weakening onchain Cardano activity
The bearishness in ADA prices today is preceded by reduced network activity and the total value locked (TVL), which has dropped sharply over the last week.
ADA’s daily DEX trading volume fell by 67% from $21 million on March 2 to $7.3 million on March 10.
Similarly, daily active addresses decreased by 59% from approximately 70,700 to 28,900 over the same period.

Cardano’s TVL has plummeted from $701.4 million on Dec. 3, 2024, to reach a four-month low of $268 million on Feb. 28.
This metric has again dropped by 25% over the last seven days.

The weekly decline in daily active addresses, DEX volume and TVL coincides with ADA’s 10% price drop over the same period.
Buyer exhaustion hampers ADA price
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows ADA’s rally on March 2 pushed the relative strength index (RSI) above 70 in multiple timeframes, indicating “overbought” conditions. 
On March 2, ADA’s RSI reached as high as 90, 84 and 73 on the four-hour, 12-hour and daily timeframes, respectively.
An overbought RSI implies that the rally is likely overheating, and the buyers have become exhausted. 
Consequently, traders may take this as a signal to sell and lock in profits, leading the price to either consolidate sideways or fall further.
ADA/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
In ADA’s case, the price has been dropping since then, recording lower highs and lower lows, as shown in the chart above.
Thus, the downward target for the short term is between the March 11 intra-day low of around $0.6472 and the range low at $0.5794 reached on Feb. 28.

The second area of interest lies between the Feb. 3 low at $0.5569 and the range low at $0.5197 reached on Nov. 13. 
This demand zone could potentially provide a good entry position for late investors.

BTC price bounces back amid calls for short squeeze
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed daily BTC price gains approaching 4%.
New four-month lows had accompanied the previous day’s Wall Street trading session as recession fears sent risk-asset investors fleeing.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index finished the day down 2.7% and 4%, respectively. At the time of writing, Nasdaq 100 futures had recovered around 0.4% from a trip to their lowest levels since September 2024.
Commenting, trading resource The Kobeissi Letter suggested that markets had entered an unsustainable downtrend.
“Are we overdue for a massive short squeeze?” it queried in a thread on X, noting risk-asset sentiment in “extreme fear” territory.
“Even bears who are calling for a prolonged bear market would need to see some relief rallies. Markets do not move in a straight-line long-term. Eventually, a (tradable) short squeeze is inevitable.”

“$VIX has only been higher 11% of the time, going back to 1990,” network economist Timothy Peterson, creator of several Bitcoin price forecasting tools, continued.

US recession fears hurt XRP price
Escalating concerns over a potential US economic slowdown have dampened investor sentiment across financial markets, hurting XRP and the broader cryptocurrency sector.
Key points:
Crypto and tech stocks saw a large sell-off on March 10 due to rising US recession fears.
JPMorgan raised the US recession risk to 40%, up from 30% at the start of 2025, citing extreme US policies as a key risk.
The Trump administration’s recent imposition of tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China has heightened fears of a global trade war.
President Trump’s acknowledgment of a potential recession during a ""period of transition"" has further unsettled investors.
Goldman Sachs has also increased its 12-month recession probability to 20%, up from 15%, warning that the forecast could rise if Trump maintains current policies.
The Nasdaq E-Mini Futures has dropped by nearly 6% over the past week, coinciding with a 1.18% plunge in the 10-year Treasury note yields.

On the other hand, the Euro and Japanese Yen are rising.

Together, these performances indicate a growing rush toward what investors consider “safe havens,” especially as the Trump trade war hurts US economic growth prospects.
White House Crypto Summit fails to impress XRP bulls
XRP's price took a sharp hit following the White House’s inaugural Crypto Summit on March 7, as hopes for its inclusion in a US strategic crypto reserve were swiftly dashed.
Key takeaways:
Initial excitement faded after President Donald Trump’s team clarified that Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP were used as illustrative examples, not official selections for the US reserve.
Related: Crypto ETPs see 4th straight week of outflows, totaling $876M — CoinShares
Trump’s crypto strategy favors altcoin reserves but excludes new purchases, limiting XRP’s chances of institutional accumulation.
No evidence exists that the US government holds XRP, further diminishing investor optimism.
Conversely, Bitcoin remains the clear winner, with the US government holding approximately $17.7 billion in BTC, reinforcing its dominance.
The XRP/BTC pair has dropped by 15% in the past two weeks while consolidating within a historical distribution zone.

A break below the 200-2W exponential moving average (200-2W EMA; the blue wave) at around 1,700 satoshis could send XRP/BTC toward the 50-2W EMA (~1,700 satoshis).
XRP risks 45% crash ahead
XRP’s price decline today is furthermore a part of its prevailing head-and-shoulders pattern.
Key points:
An H&S pattern forms when the price forms three consecutive highs, with the middle peak (head) higher than the other two (shoulders).
As a technical rule, the pattern resolves when the price breaks below its common support (neckline) and falls by as much as the pattern’s maximum height.
XRP/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView
As of March 10, XRP had formed what appears to be the H&S pattern’s right shoulder and was heading toward the neckline support at around $2.
A decisive breakdown below the support level could send the XRP price toward $1.11 by April, down by over 45% from the current prices.
Can XRP resume its bull run?
A rebound from $2 neckline support could delay or invalidate the H&S pattern.
Interestingly, the level aligns with two other support levels: the lower trendline of XRP’s prevailing symmetrical triangle pattern and the 50-3D EMA.
XRP/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView
A bounce, followed by a decisive close above the triangle’s upper trendline, could trigger a breakout scenario toward $3.44.
The upside target is measured after adding the triangle’s maximum height to the breakout point (considered to be at the triangle’s apex point at $2.05).

Investors flee from risk assets as JPMorgan ups recession odds to 40%,https://cointelegraph.com/news/investors-skitter-off-risk-assets-jpmorgan-raises-recession-chances,2025-03-11,"Crypto and tech stocks saw large selloffs on March 10 as fears of a US recession heightened despite efforts from the White House to temper concerns. 
Economists at Wall Street investment bank JPMorgan have raised their recession risk this year to 40%, up from 30% at the beginning of 2025. “We see a material risk that the US falls into recession this year owing to extreme US policies,” wrote the analysts, according to The Wall Street Journal. 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs economists also raised their 12-month recession probability to 20%, up from 15%. They said that the forecast could rise further if the Trump administration remains “committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data.” 
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley economists lowered their economic growth forecasts last week and raised inflation expectations. The bank predicted a GDP growth of just 1.5% in 2025, falling to 1.2% in 2026. 
It comes despite a key economic adviser to US President Donald Trump pushed back against talks of a recession. Speaking to CNBC on March 10, Kevin Hassett, who heads the National Economic Council, said there were many reasons to be optimistic about the US economy. 
“There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward. But for sure, this quarter, there are some blips in the data,” he said. 
Meanwhile, in an interview with Fox News on March 9, Donald Trump responded to a question about the possibility of a recession by saying the US economy was going through “a period of transition.”
Blockchain betting platform Polymarket quipped that recession odds are “the best looking chart in finance right now.”

The Magnificent 7 — America’s top tech firms — have had a tumultuous start to the week, collectively shedding more than $750 billion in market cap in one day. Tesla tanked a whopping 15%, becoming the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year.
AI giant Nvidia lost 5.1%, Apple shed 4.9%, Meta fell 4.4% and Alphabet lost 4.5% on the day.

price dropped below $2,600 on Feb. 24 and has since struggled to sustain a meaningful recovery. The latest correction toward the $2,000 level triggered over $918 million in leveraged long (bull) liquidations in ETH futures within 15 days, according to CoinGlass data.

SOL
$125.38
. This suggests that additional factors are hampering ETH’s price, and four major issues need to be addressed before Ether can reclaim a bull market.
Ethereum’s upgrades and increased competition 
For some, the upcoming Pectra upgrade on the Ethereum network falls short of what is needed to drive a meaningful turnaround, whether it lowers base-layer transaction fees or significantly enhances usability.
Even if the changes do improve the user experience, analysts argue that Ethereum still lacks interoperability across different layer-2 solutions, both in terms of liquidity and user accessibility.
Recent reports of empty blocks on the Ethereum testnet have added to risk perception at a time when investors were already skeptical. Regardless of whether this issue is unrelated to the upcoming upgrade or easily fixable, some traders worry that any potential delay could be perceived negatively by the market.

In essence, fear remains the dominant sentiment, and for this to change, several pressing issues must be resolved.
Critics argue that part of ETH investors’ disappointment stems from the rise of indirect competitors, such as the modular layer-1 Berachain, which focuses on integrating liquidity and governance for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.
7-day protocol fees ranking, USD. Source: DefiLlama
Berachain has successfully captured over $3 billion in deposits, as measured by total value locked (TVL) on DefiLlama.
Similarly, Hyperliquid, a perpetual futures application hosted on its own blockchain, has surpassed $2.8 billion in open interest, outpacing competitors on the Ethereum network. In many ways, competition is growing beyond the traditional model.
For ETH's price to regain bullish momentum, traders need reassurance that the Ethereum network offers practical and clear advantages for its projects and users. Ultimately, Ethereum's focus on decentralization and incremental improvements—whether justified or not—could be stemming demand compared to its competition.  
Weak onchain activity and institutional demand
The lack of demand from institutional investors is evident in the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows, which were negative in nine of the last 10 trading days, resulting in $406 million in net withdrawals.
Some analysts suggested that demand could surge following the eventual approval of native staking on Ethereum ETFs, but this theory is now less certain, given that the ETH supply is increasing at 0.7% annually.
Lower demand for blockchain processing has reduced the burn-fee mechanism, causing Ether to become inflationary. As a result, the adjusted native staking reward is now below 2.5%, while deposits in stablecoins yield up to 4.5% in most DeFi projects.
Ultimately, the eventual inclusion of staking in spot ETFs is unlikely to be a game-changer for institutional demand.

Lastly, traders are concerned that the US Securities and Exchange Commission may approve a spot Solana ETF in 2025, creating direct competition for investors who currently only have access to Ether and Bitcoin
BTC
$82,454
ETF products.
Therefore, for ETH price to reach $2,500 and beyond, investors need clearer evidence that Ethereum offers sustainable advantages beyond its first-mover advantage.
In summary, Ether’s future depends on Ethereum network upgrades, increased network usage, a subsequent decline in supply, and reduced friction for layer-2 interoperability, ensuring that the entire ecosystem benefits from its growth.

reserve, several cryptocurrency executives told Cointelegraph. 
Trump’s March 6 executive order creating a US strategic Bitcoin reserve and a separate digital asset stockpile for altcoins left crypto industry executives underwhelmed. 
Meanwhile, they are still waiting for the White House to provide detailed guidance on issues like securities regulation and taxation, the executives said. 
“Markets expect a roadmap for innovation and clear guidelines on stablecoins, institutional adoption and taxation,” Max Giammario, CEO of Web3 artificial intelligence startup Kindred, told Cointelegraph.
“Instead, the vague rhetoric and lack of immediate action only deepened uncertainty.”

Campaign promises
In July, Trump promised to turn America into the “world’s crypto capital” and create a US Bitcoin reserve akin to the nation’s gold stockpile. 
Trump’s March 6 executive order delivered on his campaign promise but left traders disappointed. 
Instead of instructing the US government to buy crypto, the reserve and the stockpile will initially only comprise digital assets seized by law enforcement. 
Bitcoin is down approximately 13% from March 6 as traders react to the news amid a backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty. 
Altcoins have clocked similar losses, with the total crypto market capitalization shedding more than $400 million. 
Those losses could worsen without clearer US policy guidance soon, industry executives said.
“If Trump’s administration provides clearer regulations on stablecoins, ETFs and institutional adoption, altcoins could regain momentum,” Alvin Kan, chief operating officer of Bitget Wallet, told Cointelegraph.
“Otherwise, Bitcoin dominance may continue, as it remains the primary macro asset.”
Reasons for optimism
Even so, crypto industry executives remain optimistic, citing Trump’s pro-crypto rhetoric and his appointment of industry-friendly leaders to key US regulatory posts. 
“The future of US crypto policy under Trump […] remains to be seen,” Theodore Agranat, Gunzilla Games’ director of Web3, told Cointelegraph. 
“However, given the people in all the crucial positions, we should expect to see a stream of ongoing and positive initiatives and news for crypto in general and especially crypto projects in the US.”

$82,447
bulls tried to push the price above $85,000, but the bears held their ground. A minor positive is that larger investors seem to be accumulating at lower levels.
Research firm Santiment said in a post on X that wallets with 10 BTC or more have bought roughly 5,000 Bitcoin since March 3. The researchers added that if buying by the large players continues, the second half of March could be much better than the recent performance of Bitcoin.
However, not everyone is bullish on Bitcoin in the near term. BitMEX co-founder and Maelstrom chief investment officer Arthur Hayes said in a post on X that Bitcoin could retest $78,000 and even below $75,000.
He added that Bitcoin’s price action could become violent if it drops in the $70,000 to $75,000 zone as a lot of Bitcoin open interest is stuck in that range.

Meanwhile, short-term investor sentiment remains bearish. According to CoinShares data, cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) witnessed $876 million in outflows last week, taking the four-week total outflows to $4.75 billion. Bitcoin ETPs recorded the lion’s share of outflows at $756 million.
Can Bitcoin start a recovery from the current levels, pulling altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts to find out.
S&P 500 Index price analysis
The S&P 500 Index (SPX) turned down from the 20-day exponential moving average (5,900) on March 3 and broke below the 5,773 support on March 6, completing a double-top pattern.
SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The index bounced off the 5,670 level on March 7, but the bears successfully defended the breakdown level of 5,773. The index turned down and broke below the 5,670 support on March 10, opening the doors for a fall to 5,400.
Buyers will have to push and sustain the price above 5,773 to suggest solid demand at lower levels. The index could then rise to the 20-day EMA, which is again expected to act as a strong resistance. 
US Dollar Index price analysis
The US Dollar Index (DXY) turned down sharply on March 3 and continued lower, breaking below the 105.42 support on March 5.
DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The fall below 105.42 suggests that the breakout above 108 may have been a bull trap. Buyers are trying to defend the 103.73 level, but the relief rally is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA (106.03). 
If the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA, it will suggest a negative sentiment. That increases the risk of a break below 103.37. If that happens, the index may plunge to 101.
Buyers have an uphill task ahead of them. They will have to push and maintain the price above the 20-day EMA to clear the path for a rally to 108.

The bulls are trying to defend the $81,500 to $78,258 support zone, but the recovery attempt faced selling at the breakdown level on March 10. That suggests the bears are trying to flip the support line into resistance. If the price skids below $78,258, the BTC/USDT pair could collapse to $73,777.
Buyers are likely to have other plans. They will try to defend the support zone and push the price above the 20-day EMA ($88,605). If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to the resistance line.

Buyers tried to push the price above $2,111 on March 10, but the long wick on the candlestick suggests solid selling by the bears. There is minor support at $1,993, but if the level cracks, the ETH/USDT pair could sink to $1,750 and eventually to $1,550.

The bulls will have to push and maintain the price above the 20-day EMA ($2,329) to signal that the break below $2,111 may have been a bear trap. The pair could then rally to the 50-day SMA ($2,711).

Related: Is XRP price going to crash again?
Contrary to this assumption, a solid bounce off $2 will signal that the bulls are vigorously defending this level. The 20-day EMA ($2.40) is likely to act as a stiff hurdle, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could reach $2.80.

The down-sloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the price maintains below $546, the BNB/USDT pair could plummet to $500. Buyers are expected to aggressively defend the zone between $500 and $460.
The 20-day EMA is the first significant resistance to watch out for on the upside. If this level gets taken out, the pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($633). A close above the 50-day SMA signals a short-term trend change.

broke below the uptrend line on March 9 and reached the strong support zone between $120 and $110.

The bulls are expected to fiercely defend the support zone, but the relief rally could face selling at the 20-day EMA ($150). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the $110 level will be at risk of breaking down. If that happens, the SOL/USDT pair could decline to $100 and later to $80.
Instead, if the price rises from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest solid buying near the support zone. The pair could then climb to the 50-day SMA ($188).

fell below the $0.18 support on March 9, indicating the resumption of the downtrend.

The down-sloping moving averages and the RSI in the oversold territory suggest that bears have the upper hand. The 20-day EMA ($0.21) is the critical overhead resistance to watch out for. If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the DOGE/USDT pair could sink to $0.14.
Alternatively, a break and close above the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair could climb to the 50-day SMA ($0.26), which may also act as a stiff resistance.
Cardano price analysis
Cardano
ADA
$0.7121
fell below the moving averages on March 8, indicating aggressive selling by the bears.
ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
Both moving averages have started to turn down, and the RSI has slipped into negative territory, indicating that the bears have a slight edge. The support on the downside is at $0.58 and then $0.50.
Any relief rally is likely to face selling at the moving averages. Buyers will have to push and maintain the price above the moving averages to signal a comeback. The ADA/USDT pair could then rise toward $1.02.
Pi price analysis
Pi (PI) fell to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $1.20 on March 9, indicating that the bears have kept up the pressure.
PI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
Buyers are trying to start a recovery, but the long wick on the March 10 candlestick shows selling at higher levels. That increases the risk of a break below $1.20. If that happens, the PI/USDT pair could plunge to the 78.6% retracement level of $0.72.
Time is running out for the bulls. To prevent more downside, they will have to quickly push the price above the $2 overhead resistance. If they do that, it will suggest that the correction may be over.

BTC price sags closer to new four-month lows
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD down around 4% on the day to reach $79,170 on Bitstamp.
Weakness into the weekly close continued as risk assets across the board suffered a flight to safety.
Stocks fell substantially at the open, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index down 2% and 3.5%, respectively.
Reacting, trading resource The Kobeissi Letter said that US government spending cutbacks at the hands of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) played a role in the slump.
“While everyone is focused on the trade war, do not discount the impact of reduced government spending expectations,” it wrote in part of its latest analysis on X. 
“Government spending and job growth have been ‘fueling’ the economy. DOGE's cuts will be felt.”

Kobeissi noted that crypto markets had erased $1 trillion in market cap in just two months.
“The rally after the U.S. Strategic Reserve was announced has been completely erased,” it added on BTC/USD.
Market participants’ views were mixed as it became unclear where BTC price action might put in a more reliable floor.

Popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital advised X followers to look for rising relative strength index (RSI) values against lower prices for reversal cues.
“Going forward, it'll be worth watching for Bitcoin to form Lower Lows on the price action and Higher Lows on the RSI for a Bullish Divergence to develop,” he wrote about daily timeframes.

A further post noted that the current bull cycle had produced bounces whenever the daily RSI was below 28. 
Specifically, “Bitcoin's price would either bottom or be between -2% to -8% away from a bottom,” he explained. 
Daily RSI stood at 33.2 at the time of writing.

Bybit hack remains the elephant in the room
Elsewhere, trading firm QCP Capital pinned the blame for the broader crypto market downside on sell-offs tied to last month’s hack of crypto exchange Bybit.

“Today's price selloff may also be exacerbated by holders preemptively front-running further hacker-driven supply, now that the hackers have shown willingness to cash out rather than risk further losses — having already seen their stolen assets depreciate by 25%,” it wrote in its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers. 
“In response, risk reversals have become even more bid for Puts over the past 24 hours, reflecting growing concerns over additional selling pressure.”
QCP data showed market expectations becoming more optimistic only from Q3 onward.
“Until crypto finds a new narrative, we're likely to see an increased correlation between BTC and equities in the near term,” it concluded, referencing upcoming US macroeconomic data releases. 
“Both risk assets are currently trading near their recent lows, and with tariff risks still looming, volatility could pick up heading into key U.S. macro data releases — CPI (Wed) and PPI (Thu).”

Bitcoin may benefit from US stablecoin dominance push,https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoin-push-dollar-dominance-positive-for-bitcoin,2025-03-10,"The US push to maintain the dollar’s global dominance through stablecoin adoption could have unintended benefits for Bitcoin as it emerges as a potential national reserve asset.
During the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the American government would use stablecoins to ensure the US dollar remains the world’s global reserve currency.
“We are going to put a lot of thought into the stablecoin regime, and as President Trump has directed, we are going to keep the US [dollar] the dominant reserve currency in the world,” Bessent said.
The treasury secretary also repeated the Trump administration’s promise to end the war on crypto and committed to rolling back previous Internal Revenue Service guidance and punitive regulatory measures.

The comments came just before Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin

reserve using cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases. While the order does not involve direct federal Bitcoin purchases, it represents a shift in how the government views the cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin may benefit from the growing stablecoin adoption and push for more regulatory clarity, according to Omri Hanover, general manager at the Gems Trade blockchain launchpad. 
“If Trump’s policy strengthens US financial dominance, Europe’s reluctance and ‘wait-and-see’ approach could weaken its economic leverage,” he told Cointelegraph, adding:
“This divide creates two market realities: US accelerates Bitcoin’s institutional adoption, drawing capital; and EU prioritizes compliance, risking a capital shift to US markets.”

Meanwhile, two major bills await congressional approval: the Stablecoin bill and the Market Structure bill, which aim to help lift the regulatory uncertainty around the US crypto industry.
Meanwhile, pro-crypto lawmakers have focused on two major legislative priorities — stablecoins and general market structure clarity — which would help lift the regulatory uncertainty around the US crypto industry. However, no related bills have yet been passed by Congress.

In the past 83 days, it declined by 51%, translating to an average daily loss of approximately 0.61%. If the losses are compounded daily, the rate increases to about 0.84%.
Ethereum exchange outflows hit 27-month high
According to IntoTheBlock, a crypto analytics platform, Ethereum witnessed significant outflows worth $1.8 billion over the past week. It was the highest weekly outflow since December 2022, and in an X post, the platform added,
“Despite ongoing pessimism around Ether prices, this trend suggests many holders see current levels as a strategic buying opportunity.”

Fellow onchain data provider CryptoQuant paints a similar picture. The 30-day simple-moving average of Ethereum netflows dropped to roughly 30,000 ETH last week, which was last recorded toward the end of December 2022.

An MVRV ratio below 1 indicates undervaluation, signaling a potential buying opportunity. For context, when the MVRV ratio dropped to 0.8 on Oct. 18, 2023, Ether registered a local bottom near $1,600, followed by a bullish reversal and the beginning of the 2024 bull run.
Is the Ethereum bottom in?
Ether price is currently consolidating near its psychological level at $2,000, following a steady correction since the beginning of 2025.
With respect to this intraday price action, Mikybull, a technical analyst, points out that Ethereum is “showing a bullish reversal” with a diamond price pattern.

A diamond pattern after a downtrend suggests a potential bullish reversal. Based on this pattern’s measured target, Ether could rebound about 20% to $2,600 from its current price.

On the flip side, Ether’s weekly chart closed below the 200-day EMA level for the first time since October 2023. Since 2020, ETH price has remained under this indicator for less than 15% of the time. Previously, Ether rebounded in the following week every time it dropped below this trendline in 2023.

However, a prolonged period under this line may extend ETH’s bottom price target. Thus, it will be critical for Ethereum to bounce back above this EMA trendline to confirm the bottom over the next few days or weeks.

European lawmakers silent on US Bitcoin reserve amid digital euro push,https://cointelegraph.com/news/european-lawmakers-silent-trump-bitcoin-reserve-amid-cbdc-push,2025-03-10,"European lawmakers have remained silent on the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve order, a landmark policy shift favoring early adopters of Bitcoin due to its economic model.
US President Donald Trump’s March 7 executive order outlined a plan to create a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency seized in criminal cases rather than purchasing Bitcoin
BTC

on the market.
Despite the significance of the move, European policymakers have yet to make any major public statements regarding Bitcoin reserves, raising questions about their stance on integrating BTC into national reserves.
This may signal a lack of European Bitcoin reserve-related efforts due to the lengthy process of adding new national reserve assets, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum. She said:
“Usually there is a very clear legislative or executive process in adding different assets to the national treasuries, and in many cases, it is not an active voter or central bank support to push this through.”
“[The] ECB [European Central Bank] historically and currently is very critical of BTC as a reserve asset, so it effectively closes the doors to all EU member states,” Plotnikova added.
Meanwhile, European lawmakers are preparing to launch the digital euro, a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Digital euro push presents payment infrastructure concerns
European lawmakers’ silence on Trump’s Bitcoin reserve order is likely due to its focus on the digital euro, according to James Wo, the founder and CEO of venture capital firm DFG.

“This stems from the ECB’s firm stance against holding Bitcoin in its reserves, as reiterated by ECB President Christine Lagarde,” Wo told Cointelegraph, adding:
“This highlights the EU’s greater emphasis on the digital euro, though the recent outage in the ECB’s Target 2 (T2) payment system, which caused significant transaction delays, raised concerns about its ability to oversee a digital currency when it struggles with daily operations.”
Related: Bitcoin reserve backlash signals unrealistic industry expectations
European lawmakers push ahead with digital euro launch for October 2025
Despite skepticism, ECB President Christine Lagarde is pushing ahead with the digital euro’s rollout, expected in October 2025. Lagarde has emphasized that the CBDC will coexist with cash and offer privacy protections to address concerns about government overreach.
“The European Union is looking to launch the digital euro, our central bank digital currency, by October this year,” Lagarde said during a news conference, adding:
“We are working to ensure that the digital euro coexists with cash, addressing privacy concerns by making it pseudonymous and cash-like in nature.”

The United States and the European Union are taking opposite approaches to digital assets. While the EU is working to integrate a centralized digital currency, Trump has taken a firm stance against CBDCs.
While CBDCs have been praised for their potential to increase financial inclusion, critics have raised concerns about their surveillance capabilities and the potential for government overreach.
In July 2023, Brazil’s central bank published the source code for its CBDC pilot, and it took just four days for people to notice the surveillance and control mechanisms embedded within its code, allowing the central bank to freeze or reduce user funds within CBDC wallets.

More critically, US President Donald Trump acknowledged that markets could see short-term pain from his policies, including the trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China and budget-cutting plans.
“There could be a little disruption,"" said Trump in an interview with Fox News, adding:
“If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective… we go by quarters. What we’re doing is building a foundation for the future.”
The market, which surged post-election on hopes of a deregulated, crypto-friendly administration, is now grappling with the reality that Trump’s broader economic agenda may introduce headwinds before any crypto-specific benefits materialize.
Investors continue de-risking from crypto funds
The crypto market’s ongoing correction aligns with the huge capital outflows from crypto investment products. 
Key takeaways:
Digital asset investment products saw outflows for the fourth week in a row, totaling $876 million during the week ending March 7, as per CoinShares report.
This brings outflows to $4.75 billion in the last four weeks, reducing the year-to-date inflows to $2.6 billion.
This indicates institutional investors decreased their exposure to digital assets.
Bitcoin saw the biggest share of outflows, totaling $756 million.
Total assets under management have declined by $39 billion from their peak to the current value of $142 billion, the lowest point since mid-November 2024. 
Capital flows for crypto investment products. Source: CoinShares
CoinShares head of research James Butterfill attributed this to “negative sentiment,” suggesting “capitulation” among investors.
“Although this indicates a slowdown in the pace of outflows, investor sentiment remains bearish. ”
Additionally, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plummeted to 10 on March 10, its lowest since July 2022, indicating “extreme fear.”

TOTAL validates descending triangle
From a technical perspective, today’s crypto market’s decline is part of a correction trend that saw TOTAL—the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies—drop below a descending triangle pattern.
A descending triangle is a bearish continuation pattern, forming when the price makes lower highs while maintaining a flat support level at the bottom.
The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks below the support level with high volume and drops by as much as the triangle’s maximum height.
As of March 10, TOTAL had fallen to the pattern’s target of $2.6 trillion at the 50-weekly simple moving average (SMA).
TOTAL/USD weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
If selling pressure persists, the 100–week SMA at $2 trillion could become the next downside target.
Holding the 50-week SMA as support may strengthen the ongoing rebound toward the pattern’s lower trendline, aligning with the $3.1 trillion level.

Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows that BTC went from $93,379 on March 3 to a low of $80,610 on March 10, a 13.6% drop in Bitcoin prices in one week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin had recovered slightly to trade at around $82,000. 
Despite the market downturn, Michael Saylor’s Strategy remained ahead on its BTC purchases. The company held 499,096 BTC, purchased at an average of $66,423 per token. In total, Strategy has spent $33.1 billion on Bitcoin purchases, while its holdings are now valued at $41.2 billion — a 24% unrealized gain even amid the correction.
Strategy’s Bitcoin investments highlight the importance of the dollar-cost averaging tactic in investing. Instead of buying at a lump sum, the company divided its BTC purchases at different times and continued to buy the tokens despite the prices.

While Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings remain in the green, other companies that recently entered the Bitcoin market are seeing losses.
According to Bitcoin holdings tracker BitcoinTreasuries.NET, healthcare tech and software firm Semler Scientific, which started holding BTC on May 28, is down by 6.25% on its purchases.
The company holds 3,192 BTC bought at an average price of $87,850. This means that its BTC purchased with over $280 million is now only worth around $262 million.

Metaplanet holds 2,888 bought at an average price of $83,049. It’s down by over $2 million, nearly 1%, on its Bitcoin investments. 
According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, Strategy has spent $23 billion on Bitcoin purchases since November 2024. However, with the recent price drop, the BTC acquired during this period is now worth only about $20 billion, implying an unrealized loss of over $3 billion on these recent acquisitions.

While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index continues to show “extreme fear” on March 10, one BTC market simulation still highlights bullish projections for the latter half of 2025.
Monte Carlo model signals an 800% BTC price rise
Mark Quant, a crypto researcher, performed a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze Bitcoin's price, providing a six-month forecast for the crypto asset.
The Monte Carlo model is a computational method using random sampling to simulate price projections and assess risk. It can generate multiple possible scenarios based on variable factors such as volatility and market trends.
Bitcoin Monte Carlo projections by Mark Quant. Source: X.com
Based on the initial price of $82,655, the study estimated a mean final price of $258,445 by the end of September 2025. However, on a broader scale, the price was expected to fluctuate between $51,430, i.e., a 5th percentile return and $713,000 at the 95th percentile.
Related: Bitcoin slides another 3% — Is BTC price headed for $69K next?
However, it is important to note that a Monte Carlo model relies strongly on the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model, which assumes that the asset value follows a random path with a constant parameter drift.
In this analysis, Bitcoin's inherent volatility is built into the model, capturing long-term historical performance and patterns while adapting to future shifts. Essentially, the Monte Carlo analysis remains as fitting as “rolling the dice.""
Last week, Quant also highlighted a correlation between the total crypto market cap and the global liquidity index, indicating that the TOTAL market cap value may reach new highs above $4 trillion in Q2 2025.

Bitcoin eyes new CME gap after $80K retest
Bitcoin price dropped 6.38% over the weekend, creating a fresh CME futures gap in the charts. The CME Bitcoin futures gap describes the price difference between the closing of CME Bitcoin futures trading on Friday and its reopening on Sunday evening.

As illustrated in the chart, the CME gap currently lies between $83,000 and $86,000, a fairly large gap of $3,000. Based on past behavior, Bitcoin tends to “fill” or return into these gaps on the higher time frame charts, with the previous seven gaps filled out in the past four months.
Mark Cullen, a technical analyst, also highlighted the CME gap, which took form over the weekend, and speculated the possibility of a short squeeze before the US markets open on March 10. However, the trader added,
“Lose the weekly open at ~80K and there is a gap down to low 70K's.”

XRP could extend the decline to the recent range low at $1.76 (formed on Feb. 3) and the support level at $1.61, where the 200-day SMA currently sits.

The bullish case for the altcoin hinges on XRP turning the resistance between $2.53 and $2.62 into support.
These levels are also the 100-day and 50-day SMAs.
A close above the 50-day SMA could pave the way for a return to $3.00 or the seven-year high above $3.40.

XRP price runs into resistance at $3.00
XRP bulls are looking to regain their strength after failing to sustain momentum over the last couple of weeks.
XRP’s 66% rally between Feb. 3 and March 2 was stopped by supplier congestion around the $3.00 level.
However, XRP is still validating a bull flag pattern in the weekly timeframe, as shown in the chart below. 
The price now rests on support at $2.16 at the upper boundary of the flag.

However, a bearish cross produced by the MACD suggests that XRP might drop further from the current levels.
As such, if XRP closes below the weekly support level of $2.16, it will drop back into the confines of the flag, where it could continue consolidating for a few more weeks.
As Cointelegraph reported, if the critical $2-level breaks, XRP can drop toward its 50-weekly exponential moving average (EMA) at $1.46, particularly as the hype around the US strategic reserve fades.
“The US government’s commitment to only selling altcoins from its new Digital Asset Stockpile is posing a threat to XRP’s uptrend prospects.“

Biggest red weekly candle ever: 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week,https://cointelegraph.com/news/biggest-red-weekly-candle-ever-5-things-bitcoin-this-week,2025-03-10,"Bitcoin starts the second week of March at a bearish crossroads as new multimonth lows get closer.
Traders and analysts agree that little stands in the way of a $78,000 retest as BTC/USD seals its worst-ever weekly candle.
CPI and PPI are due as markets enter a broad risk-off phase and stocks’ futures tumble.
How low can Bitcoin
BTC
$82,459
go? Old $69,000 all-time highs from 2021 are back on the menu.
Sentiment is on the floor, and not just in crypto, but not everyone believes that the situation is really all that bad.
Whales have been buying throughout the past week, indicating a solid risk-return basis at current price levels.

BTC price dives 14% in a week
Diving to $80,000 into the weekly close, Bitcoin’s latest weekly candle stands out for all the wrong reasons.
In US dollar terms, BTC/USD shed more value in seven days than at any time in history, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.

So far, bulls have narrowly avoided a rematch with multimonth lows from late February, but among some Bitcoin traders, the mood is predictably cautious.
“Bitcoin is back in the critical zone of the weekly parabolic trend,” analyst Kevin Svenson wrote in his latest analysis on X. 
“We are still holding the current lows of last week, no new low has been created yet. This is $BTC's last chance to maintain an exponential higher low.”

Trader SuperBro joined those preparing for a $78,000 rematch.
“Closed above the prior candle’s low and 50% level, but cracked the uptrend from Oct ’23,” a reaction to the weekly close stated.
“A candle like that rarely turns on a dime, so despite bullish divergences on the LTF I'm prepared for a sweep of the lows.”

Others sought more data to confirm a truly bearish breakdown.
“Are we in a bear market now? Simply no. There isn’t enough confluence to confirm that at all,” trader CrypNuevo argued in a dedicated X thread.
Even for him, however, new lows were on the cards, with the area around $77,000 particularly important.
“We can see some liquidations exactly at $77k in HTF, although they are not as reliable as LTF liquidations,” he continued.

CPI week overshadowed by market nerves
This week’s key US macroeconomic data releases are not in short supply, but markets are already flipping to an increasingly “risk-off” stance.

The February print of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) are both due, along with the familiar job openings and jobless claims figures.
Both CPI and PPI overshot the mark last month amid an inflation rebound, which shook mark confidence.
Since then, neither crypto nor stocks have succeeded in recovering, and with the next Federal Reserve interest rates decision coming next week, there is little sign of optimism.
The latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool puts the odds of a cut on March 19 at just 3%. Meanwhile, the Fed’s May meeting is seeing rate-cut odds rapidly decrease.

“Amid all the trade war chaos, we have seen economic growth expectations crash sharply,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of its latest X analysis.
“The Atlanta Fed reduced their Q1 2025 GDP growth estimate to as low as -2.8% last week. As a result, we saw interest rate cut expectations move up SHARPLY last week.”
Kobeissi noted that on short timeframes, stocks were gearing up for a “red” open.
“Crypto’s decline was a clear indication of growing risk-off sentiment this weekend,” it summarized.
Back to 2021 for BTC price?
Regarding BTC price bottom targets, the landscape is looking ever more nerve-racking for bulls.
With $80,000 hanging in the balance, one classic forecasting tool suggests that a reliable floor may only lie at an old Bitcoin all-time high — not from last year, but from 2021.
Created by network economist Timothy Peterson in 2019, Lowest Price Forward effectively delivers BTC price levels that will not be violated in the future.
In mid-2020, it correctly predicted that BTC/USD would never trade below $10,000 from September onward.
Now, the new line in the sand lies somewhere around $69,000.
“Lowest Price Forward doesn’t tell you where Bitcoin will be. It tells you where Bitcoin won’t be,” Peterson told X followers in a recent post this month.
“There is a 95% chance it won't fall below $69k.”

Peterson’s tool is not alone in eyeing new macro lows for BTC/USD to come.
As Cointelegraph reported, calls for a trip to the mid-$70,000 range are growing, with Bitcoin’s 50-week simple moving average (SMA) a key target at $75,560.
The 200-day SMA, traditionally a bull market support line, failed as support around the latest weekly close for the first time since last October.

“An ugly start to the week,” Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, wrote in response, referring to open interest (OI). 
“Looks like $BTC will retest $78k. If it fails, $75k is next in the crosshairs. There are a lot of options OI struck $70-$75k, if we get into that range it will be violent.”
The current multimonth low of just above $78,000 came at the end of February.
Crypto, macro sentiment match historical lows
It is no secret that Bitcoin and wider crypto market sentiment is struggling in the current environment, but the extent of the bearishness may come as a surprise.
The latest data from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index puts the overall mood firmly back in the “extreme fear” zone, with the market enjoying a mere one-day break last week.
The Index has seldom been lower in recent years, with Bitcoin’s trip to $78,000 last month sparking a three-year record reading of just 10/100.

It is not just crypto. As noted by finance and trading resource Barchart, stocks are also nervous, to an extent rarely seen this century.
“Sentiment is extremely bearish, which is actually bullish,” Peterson argued about the same data. 
“Lowest reading since the bottom of GFC and COVID crash. Markets soared after that.  Opportunities of the decade.”
Source: Barchart
Professional Capital Management founder and CEO Anthony Pompliano called on crypto investors not to pay attention to sentiment gauges at all.
“The Fear & Greed Index for crypto one year ago was at ‘Extreme Greed’ of 92. Today we are at ‘Extreme Fear’ of 17. Bitcoin is 20% higher over the same time frame,” an X post from March 10 reads.
“Don't get tricked by online sentiment. It is all noise.”
Bitcoin whales wake up
Is there light at the end of the tunnel of what has become a hefty crypto bull market pullback?

Positive cues may be few and far between, but for research firm Santiment, one stands out: large investor accumulation.
Over the first full week of March, it shows, Bitcoin whales and “sharks” — entities with 10 BTC or more — felt it appropriate to start increasing their BTC exposure again.
“In short, their mild dumping from mid-February to early March contributed to crypto’s latest dump,” Santiment wrote in part of X commentary. 
“But since March 3, wallets with 10+ $BTC have accumulated nearly 5,000 Bitcoin back into their collective wallets.”

Researchers acknowledged that price action has yet to reflect their conviction, but a delayed response could well mean that the market sees a fresh relief rally next.
“Prices have not reacted to their buying just yet, but don’t be surprised if the 2nd half of March turns out much better than the bloodbath we’ve seen since Bitcoin's ATH 7 weeks ago... assuming these large key stakeholders continue their coin collecting,” they concluded.

How low can BTC price action go before finding a bottom? Popular market participants weigh in as data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BTC/USD down over 3% on March 9.
Bitcoin eats through bid liquidity
Exchange order books are forming an area of intense interest among Bitcoin traders as the weekly candle close nears.
Liquidation levels on either side of the spot price look ripe for the taking, with longs already paying as BTC/USD sags to $83,000.
“Liquidation map says: Whales hunting stops!” popular trader TheKingfisher wrote in a warning to X followers on the day.

$75,000 BTC price dip next?
Could February’s multimonth lows of $78,000 be just the start?
A bearish BTC price take suggests that the market is not done retesting levels not seen since November last year.
For popular trader Mikybull Crypto, there is a clear chance that Bitcoin will retest its 50-week simple moving average (SMA).
“$BTC likely heading for the MA support for a potential local bottom,” he predicted.

BTC/USD last interacted with the 50-week SMA in September but has avoided a weekly candle close below it since March 2023.
The 200-day SMA, meanwhile, is also back on the radar as price challenges it as support for the first time since October.

95% odds that $69,000 will hold
As Cointelegraph reported last week, a historically accurate BTC price mechanism suggests that the real floor now lies at around $69,000.

XRP price risks another 20% drop after ‘Digital Asset Stockpile’ letdown,https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-price-risks-20-drop-digital-asset-stockpile,2025-03-08,"As of March 8, XRP
XRP
$2.30
faces mounting technical and fundamental pressures that suggest a possible 20% price decline in the near future. Drawing from recent market analyses and historical patterns, investors should watch three key signals.
XRP price chart hints at 20% drop ahead
XRP/USD is currently forming a symmetrical triangle on its weekly chart, a pattern reflecting a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers.
XRP/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView
Contrary to popular belief, symmetrical triangles are not always bullish continuation patterns. They indicate a bias conflict, often resolving with a breakout in either direction based on prevailing momentum.
Historically, crypto markets have seen such setups lead to declines rather than bull runs. For example, Ethereum’s 2018 triangle breakdown resulted in an 80% drop.

When it happens, the price typically rises or falls toward the level that is at a length equal to the triangle’s maximum height. Applying this technical rule on XRP brings its downside target to around $1.46, which aligns with the 50-week exponential moving average.
Trump embraces Bitcoin, not XRP
XRP’s price slumped following the White House’s inaugural Crypto Summit on March 7, as optimism about its potential inclusion in a US strategic crypto reserve quickly faded.
Despite initial excitement, President Donald Trump’s team clarified that the mentioned cryptocurrencies, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP, were illustrative examples, not official selections.
Moreover, there’s no evidence the US government holds XRP, and Trump’s broader stockpile strategy, focusing on altcoins, excludes new purchases. This revelation has already triggered a 10% decline in the XRP market.
Related: US crypto reserve could boost Bitcoin market cap by $460B — Research
On the other hand, Bitcoin is gaining clear favors from the Trump administration, with the US also holding approximately $17.7 billion in BTC.
Meanwhile, the XRP/BTC pair is consolidating within a historical distribution zone, though it remains above the 200-2W EMA (the blue wave) at around 2,459 satoshis.

A break below the 200-2W EMA could push XRP/BTC toward the 50-2W EMA (the red wave) at around 1,700 satoshis, triggering a correlated decline in XRP/USD and thus amplifying the risk of a 20% drop.
XRP volume explosion mirrors 2021 bear market
XRP’s trading volumes recently surged to record levels, with analyst Martunn warning that XRP is in a distribution phase, where large holders offload positions to retail buyers after a major rally.

This volume surge follows XRP’s 600% rise from November 2024 to January 2025, a classic setup for distribution.
In 2021, a similar volume explosion preceded a prolonged downtrend, as selling pressure eventually outweighed demand. If history repeats, XRP could face another major correction, aligning with the symmetrical triangle breakdown explained above.
The decline in XRP whale holdings further reflects distribution. The whale balance has dropped from 94.21 billion to 90.21 billion XRP in a year while erasing the increase from the post-US election “Trump pump.“
Whales are large investors or entities holding significant amounts, which in this case are addressed with balances of over 1 million XRP.

When whales offload, it often signals a lack of confidence in the asset’s near-term performance, as these players typically have access to better market insights or strategic plans.
Their selling can create a ripple effect, reducing liquidity and increasing selling pressure as smaller investors follow suit.

50% of female crypto investors seek long-term wealth creation — Survey,https://cointelegraph.com/news/50-female-crypto-investors-prefer-long-term-strategies-survey,2025-03-08,"Women are showing an increased interest in cryptocurrency investments, with the majority favoring long-term strategies and lower-risk assets like Bitcoin despite reporting a lack of industry knowledge, according to a new Bitpanda survey shared exclusively with Cointelegraph.

Women also tend to prefer safer digital assets. Bitcoin

“Women tend to build more diverse portfolios and focus on long-term wealth creation rather than chasing short-term gains,” according to Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget cryptocurrency exchange:
“This measured approach is exactly what the crypto ecosystem needs — investors who understand technological fundamentals and look beyond market noise.”

“Women typically adopt a ‘sit on their hands’ investment style,” with less trading frequency than men, Chen said, citing a Charles Stanley study:

“While men made 13 trades annually on average, women executed only 9. This patience and strategic thinking translates beautifully to crypto markets, where emotional reactions to volatility often lead to losses.”
Related: Reversing the gender gap: Women who kicked ass in crypto in 2024
Nkiru Uwaje, co-founder of blockchain liquidity platform Mansa, believes this reflects a fundamental difference in investment psychology between men and women:
“Women approach investing differently as part of a broader wealth-building strategy. When we invest in Bitcoin, we often consider its place within a diversified portfolio rather than viewing it in isolation.”
“Preference of holding may also lie in analyzing how investments may change. Instead of reactively selling during dips, female investors tend to observe how assets behave through market cycles,” she added.
We’re “not chasing overnight gains” or “FOMO-driven decisions”
The majority of women prefer Bitcoin, but not necessarily due to risk aversion alone.
“This approach often stems from thorough research and strategic patience,” according to Mary Pedler, founder of INPUT Comms blockchain and tech-focused communications agency.
“Many women I’ve worked and communicated with do deep research before investing and seldom make FOMO-driven decisions,” she told Cointelegraph, adding:
“When we invest in Bitcoin, it’s after understanding its fundamental value proposition — we’re not chasing overnight gains; we’re building generational wealth.”
More women entering crypto, but challenges remain
While female crypto investors are rising, a lack of education remains the main challenge for mainstream crypto adoption among women.
Over 81% of respondents admitted to being inexperienced investors, with 24% of female investors citing a lack of investment knowledge as their biggest challenge, while 41% pointed to financial constraints, according to Bitpanda’s survey. 
Related: From Binance to SheFi, the frontier is feminine
However, Bitpanda’s female users have shown steady growth. Women who started investing in January 2024 have seen an average increase of 8.1% in their investments over the past year. 
Chen highlighted that just 26% of crypto holders are women.
To bridge this gap, initiatives like Women in Ethereum Protocol (WiEP) emphasize the need for proper education, clear guidance and structured support to encourage more women to enter the crypto space.
“Women need proper education, clear guidance, and support, starting with small investment amounts,” WiEP representatives told Cointelegraph.

Nuanced announcement
On March 6, Trump signed an executive order creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve and, separately, a digital asset stockpile to hold other cryptocurrencies.

They will both initially comprise assets acquired by law enforcement and other legal proceedings. 
The order asks officials to “develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies impose no incremental costs on American taxpayers.”
“This limited scope fell short of market expectations and resulted in considerable disappointment,” Temujin Louie, CEO of Wanchain, a crosschain interoperability protocol, told Cointelegraph.
However, Trump’s “order opens the possibility of acquiring additional Bitcoin as well, as long as the acquisitions don’t cost taxpayers,” Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar, told Cointelegraph. 
“That could introduce a new buyer to the Bitcoin ecosystem.”
Market reaction
Bitcoin’s spot price dropped more than 2% on March 7, according to data from Google Finance. 
Meanwhile, data from the CME, the US’ largest derivatives exchange, shows declines of more than 2% across most of Bitcoin’s forward curve, which comprises futures contracts expiring at staggered dates. 
Futures are standardized contracts representing an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a particular future date.
Even without the US government actively buying up Bitcoin, the “US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve means… Other countries will buy bitcoin… [and] Financial institutions have no excuse” not to add BTC allocations, Ryan Rasmussen, asset manager Bitwise’s head of research, said in an X post. 
The sell-off is “a simple buy the rumor, sell the news event,” Austin Arnold, co-founder of Altcoin Daily, told Cointelegraph. “Long term, this is bullish.”

4 reasons why Solana (SOL) price could rally back to $180,https://cointelegraph.com/news/4-reasons-why-solana-sol-price-could-rally-back-to-180,2025-03-08,"Solana native token, SOL , is up by 17% after falling to a low of $125 on Feb. 28. However, it encountered strong resistance near the $180 mark. More significantly, the current price of $145 represents a 50% decline from its all-time high of $295 on Jan. 19, raising concerns among traders about SOL's ability to regain bullish momentum.
While analysts attribute the sharp decline in SOL's value to the memecoin market crash, onchain activity has declined across various sectors, including liquid staking, tokenized assets, yield aggregators, synthetic perpetuals, NFT marketplaces, and artificial intelligence infrastructure.
Solana 7-day blockchain fees, USD. Source: DefiLlama
Decreased blockchain activity suggests a reduced appetite for SOL, with Solana network fees dropping by 73% compared to four weeks ago, according to DefiLlama data. While the surge in activity was largely driven by memecoin token launches and decentralized exchange (DEX) trading, the result of SOL's fading momentum remains the same. 
The number of active addresses interacting with Jito, Solana’s largest liquid staking decentralized application, fell by 56% over the past 30 days, as per DappRadar data. Similarly, the NFT marketplace Magic Eden saw a 38% decrease in active addresses, while Save (formerly Solend), which offers collateralized lending, experienced a 42% drop in users over the same period
In comparison, the number of active addresses on Base, the Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, declined by just 2% over the same period. Even Ethereum’s base layer outperformed Solana, with the number of addresses engaging with DApps dropping by 17% over 30 days. This suggests that attributing SOL’s underperformance solely to the memecoin bubble burst is less plausible, as other networks did not experience a similar outcome.
Low leverage demand, bots and lack of Trump support limit SOL upside
Another factor limiting SOL’s upside potential is the lack of interest from leveraged traders. The funding rate on SOL perpetual futures has been negative for the past three days, meaning shorts (sellers) are paying to keep their positions open.

The current negative 0.01% 8-hour funding rate is not particularly concerning, as it translates to a mere 0.9% cost per month. However, the lack of interest from leveraged buyers following a 52% drop from its all-time high is not a positive sign for traders’ sentiment. On the other hand, unexpected news, such as the potential approval of a Solana spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, could surprise traders and trigger a short-covering rally.  
For some critics, the potential for increased activity on the Solana network is less of a concern. They argue that the narrative surrounding Solana is misleading, as reportedly 95% of the network's fees came from just 1.3% of users, mainly driven by Wintermute, a market-making firm, and maximum extractable value (MEV) bots.
Source: arndxt_xo
In short, a “tiny group of users, primarily predatory traders,"" benefited from pump-and-dump schemes, according to arndxt, author of the “Threading on the Edge” newsletter. Arndxt claims that memecoin speculation led to sandwich attacks, where a malicious trader detects a pending transaction on a decentralized exchange, places one order before and another after it, and profits from price manipulation between the transactions.
Related: WLFI’s DeFi credentials under fire after Sui partnership
Part of the reason SOL was unable to reclaim the $180 level is tied to World Liberty Financial, a semi-centralized finance application linked to President Donald Trump’s personal investments. The project has reportedly accumulated positions in Ether , Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Tron , Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), and other cryptocurrencies, but none in SOL, despite the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin on the Solana network.
Therefore, for SOL to regain its bullish momentum, four key areas of concern need to be addressed: onchain activity, leverage demand, MEV bots, and investment from Trump’s project.

The order does not instruct the federal government to buy Bitcoin. Instead, it asks officials to “develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies impose no incremental costs on American taxpayers.”
Additionally, the order clarifies that the federal government will not acquire any other cryptocurrencies. 
“The market appears disappointed by this,” Katalin Tischhauser, Sygnum’s research head, told Cointelegraph on March 7. 
However, “this is based on a lack of understanding of what constitutional powers the US president has,” Tischhauser said, adding that a “reserve where the US government buys Bitcoin can only be authorized by the legislature.”

Muted response
Traders’ initial response was muted. Bitcoin’s spot price dropped about 2% on March 7, according to data from TradingView. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s 24-hour average true range (ATR) — a measure of volatility — broke 5,000 for the first time this cycle. It hovered around 3,000 as recently as February. 
In addition, Bitcoin futures recoiled. Data from the CME, the US’s largest derivative exchange, shows declines of about 2% across most of Bitcoin’s forward curve, which comprises futures contracts expiring at staggered dates. 
Futures are standardized contracts representing an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a particular future date.
The CME’s July 2025 Bitcoin futures price dropped by more than 4%, indicating a bearish turn for medium-term sentiment. 
The executive order’s “longer-term effects depend on the reserve’s size, the specific cryptocurrencies included and how it is managed,” Syracuse University professor Cristiano Bellavitis told Cointelegraph.
“It’s unclear if or how much the US government would invest in crypto. If it were in the billions, the price impact could be substantial.”

Bitcoin price all-time highs historically linked to US Dollar Index declines — Analyst,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-all-time-highs-historically-linked-to-us-dollar-index-declines-analyst,2025-03-08,"Bitcoin has struggled to trade above $90,000 since falling below $95,000 on Feb. 24. The crypto asset has been subjected to severe price fluctuations over the past week, with Bitcoin’s realized volatility, reaching its highest level since Q3 2024, according to Glassnode.

While the market braced for further price swings ahead of the first-ever US crypto summit at the White House, analysts have also focused on the US dollar’s current plunge and its potential impact on Bitcoin.
Bitcoin, US Dollar Index correlation hints at new highs
James Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Real Vision, provided a detailed analysis examining the historical relevance of the declining US Dollar Index (DXY) and Bitcoin. With the DXY exhibiting its fourth-largest 3-day decline in history, exceeding -2% to -2.5%, Coutts said it could catalyze new Bitcoin highs.

Addressing historical data since 2013, the Coutts backtested the correlation between DXY dips and Bitcoin trends and analyzed the data DXY declines in the 2% and 2.5% range.
When DXY value drops 2.5% or more:
Bitcoin has risen 100% of the time.
The best case could produce a +1 standard deviation move of 65% or a $143,000 Bitcoin price
The base case predicts an average return of 37% or $123,000 Bitcoin price
The worst-case outcome entails a 14% gain or a $102,000 Bitcoin price
In the case of a DXY drop of 2% or more:
Bitcoin has risen 17 out of 18 times, with a 94% win rate over 90 days
Best-case, a +1 standard deviation move of 57.8% or $141,000
Base-case, an average return of 31.6% or $118,000
Worst case, a 14.6% decline or $76,500
With DXY dropping by 3% between March 3 and March 6, Coutts made a “bold call” and predicted new all-time highs (ATH) by May 2025.

Similarly, Julien Bittel, macro research head at Global Macro Investor, echoed the possibility of an uptrend for Bitcoin based on DXY’s current decline. The analyst said,
“1) Financial conditions lead risk assets by a couple of months. 2) Right now, financial conditions are easing – and fast...”

Bitcoin eyes $140K after “Power of 3” breakout
Santiment, a data analytics platform, highlighted that more than 50,000 wallets had been added to the network over the past month. The data suggested that 37,390 new wallets held less than 0.1 BTC, 12,754 wallets held between 0.1-100 BTC, and six whale wallets held at least 100 BTC each.

This type of activity suggests that investors remain optimistic about the long-term prospects despite the price trending downward over the past month.
From a technical perspective, Jelle, a crypto investor, believed that Bitcoin’s “Power of Three” setup remained active at the moment. The analyst said,
“Bitcoin still looks eager to reclaim $91,200. Once it does - the power of three setups comes into play; with a target of $140,000.”

BTC
$82,476
rebounded off the intraday low on March 7 and is trying to claw back above the $90,000 resistance, indicating buying at lower levels. Bitcoin sold off after the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve executive order signed by US President Donald Trump fell short of expectations. 
However, some analysts consider the reserve formation to be bullish as they expect other nations to follow the US in establishing their own strategic Bitcoin reserves. Additionally, the reserve mitigates the fears some institutional investors have about buying Bitcoin. 
Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase, but that is not likely to end the bull run. Bitcoin is expected to make a new all-time high above $109,000 before the end of June this year.

Not everyone is positive in the near term. Bitfinex analysts told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is likely to remain range-bound as the US will not make any new purchases. However, the analysts believe the move was a step in the right direction. They said that Trump’s Bitcoin reserve is a softer approach, which is likely to meet less resistance and could be a good place to start experimenting with Bitcoin as a reserve asset.
Could Bitcoin rise and maintain above $90,000? Will that pull altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.
Bitcoin price analysis
Bitcoin rebounded off the $85,000 level on March 7, signaling that the bulls are trying to form a higher low.
BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
A break and close above the 20-day exponential moving average ($90,977) will be the first sign that the bulls are back in the game. The BTC/USDT pair could then rise to the 50-day simple moving average ($96,861). Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between the 50-day SMA and $100,000, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could surge toward $109,588.
The bears will gain the upper hand if they sink and maintain the price below $85,000. If that happens, the pair could nosedive to $78,258 and, after that, to $73,777.
Ether price analysis
Ether
ETH
$1,901
fell to the $2,111 support on March 7, indicating that the bears have kept up the pressure. A minor positive is that the bulls are defending the level, as seen from the long tail on the candlestick.
ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The bulls will try to push the price to the 20-day EMA ($2,423), which remains the key short-term level to watch out for. If buyers push the price above the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the bears are losing their grip. The bulls will be back in the driver’s seat on a break and close above the downtrend line.
Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below $2,111, it will indicate the start of the next leg of the downtrend. The ETH/USDT pair may collapse to $1,750.
XRP price analysis
XRP
XRP
$2.30
closed above the 20-day EMA ($2.49) on March 6, but the bulls could not sustain the momentum and clear the 50-day SMA ($2.68) hurdle.

The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a range-bound action in the short term. If the price slips and remains below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair could drop to $2.20. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $2.20 to $2 zone. A solid bounce off the support zone suggests a range formation between $2.20 and $3.
If buyers kick the price above $3, the pair could pick up momentum and reach $3.40. Sellers will try to defend the $3.40 level with all their might because if they fail in their endeavor, the pair could skyrocket toward $5.
BNB price analysis
BNB
BNB
$578.13
turned down from the 20-day EMA ($616) on March 6, but a positive sign is that the bulls did not cede much ground to the bears.
BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
That increases the likelihood of a break above the 20-day EMA. The relief rally is expected to face significant resistance at the 50-day SMA ($642), but if the buyers overcome it, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to $686.
This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the $546 support. That could sink the pair to $500, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.
Solana price analysis
Solana
SOL
$125.40
has been taking support at the uptrend line, indicating that the bulls are trying to start a recovery.
SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The 20-day EMA ($158) is the critical overhead resistance to watch out for. If buyers clear this hurdle, the SOL/USDT pair could jump to $180. Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the $180 level because a break above it suggests the correction may be over. The pair may then ascend to $220.
Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the uptrend line, it will signal that the bears have maintained their selling pressure. The pair could tumble to $120 and later to $110.
Cardano price analysis
Cardano
ADA
$0.7129
turned down from $1.02 on March 5 and reached the 20-day EMA ($0.82) on March 7.
ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again attempt to drive the ADA/USDT pair above $1.02. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally toward the crucial overhead resistance at $1.25.
Contrarily, if the price turns down from $1.02, it will signal that bears are active at higher levels. The pair could then form a range between $1.02 and $0.75. A break and close below $0.75 may sink the pair to $0.60.
Dogecoin price analysis

Buyers attempted to start a recovery in Dogecoin
DOGE
$0.1697
but met with solid selling from the bears at the 20-day EMA ($0.22) on March 6.
DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
Sellers will have to sink the price below $0.18 to signal the start of the next leg of the downtrend. The DOGE/USDT pair could slump to $0.14 and subsequently to $0.10, where the buyers are expected to step in.
This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a rise to the 50-day SMA ($0.27). The pair may then remain inside the descending channel for a few more days.

Pi price analysis
Buyers could not sustain Pi (PI) above the $2 level on March 5, indicating a lack of demand at higher levels.
PI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The bears will try to pull the price down to $1.60 and then to $1.51. If the price rebounds off the $1.51 level, it will suggest that the PI/USDT pair could form a range in the near term. The pair could swing between $1.51 and $2 for a while.
Instead, if buyers drive the price above $2, it will signal that the bulls are back in the game. The pair could climb to $2.35 and then to $2.80. On the downside, a break and close below $1.51 could sink the pair to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $1.20.
Hedera price analysis
Hedera
HBAR
$0.1903
has been squeezed between the moving averages for some time, increasing the possibility of a range expansion in the next few days.
HBAR/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
If buyers propel the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.26), the HBAR/USDT pair could rise to $0.29. This is a critical short-term resistance to watch out for because a break above it suggests that the correction has ended. The pair could then rise to $0.35.
Alternatively, if the price turns down and closes below $0.22, it will indicate that the bears have overpowered the bulls. The pair could plummet to $0.17, where the bulls are expected to mount a solid defense. 
Chainlink price analysis
Chainlink
LINK
$13.71
closed above the 20-day EMA ($16.81) on March 6, indicating solid buying at lower levels.
LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
There is minor resistance at $18, but if the bulls overcome it, the LINK/USDT pair could climb to the 50-day SMA ($19.91). Such a move will suggest that the pair may extend its stay inside the channel for some more time. A trend change will be signaled after buyers push and maintain the price above the resistance line.
Sellers will have to quickly yank the price below $13 to retain their advantage. That could open the doors for a fall to $10.

Bitcoin leaps toward $90K as US jobs data offers pre-crypto summit boost,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-leaps-90k-us-jobs-data-crypto-summit-boost,2025-03-08,"Bitcoin stayed close to $90,000 at the March 7 Wall Street open as positive US commentary accompanied the White House Crypto Summit.
BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
Bitcoin seeks $90,000 reclaim amid risk-asset “fear”
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC price volatility staying measured at the start of a hectic day for crypto markets.
US unemployment numbers provided an initial boost as nonfarm payrolls (NFP) came in below forecast levels, hinting at the potential for financial policy easing to come sooner.
“Stock market futures are surging on the data release. This seems to be largely due to the fact that the report was not too far out of expectations,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of an initial reaction on X. 
“Another sign of a ton of fear priced-in to this market.”
Crypto market sentiment nonetheless got a helping hand in the form of US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who preceded the Summit event with a call to bring Bitcoin “onshore.”
“I’m a big proponent of the US taking the worldwide lead in crypto. I think we have to bring it onshore and use our best practices and regulations,” he said in an interview with CNBC. 
“I think that the Bitcoin Reserve — before you can accumulate it — you have to stop selling it.”
Bessent referred to the executive order signed by President Donald Trump the day prior, which halted sales of confiscated BTC while holding off on direct additional purchases — a move that initially caused BTC/USD to fall sharply.
Trading firm QCP Capital argued that the executive order had removed the bulk of intrigue around the Summit event.
“With the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve announcement now out of the way, expectations for tonight's White House Crypto Summit have been tempered,” it told Telegram channel subscribers earlier on the day. 
“Instead, the focus will be on tonight's NFP. Given how fragile equities are looking, any surprises in the data could spark volatility across risk assets — including crypto.”
Liquidity crowds Bitcoin spot price
Looking at BTC price action, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades drew comparisons to Bitcoin’s consolidation phase, which took up more than half of 2024.
Related: Bitcoin gets March 25 'blast-off date' as US dollar hits 4-month low
BTC/USD, he argued in his latest X analysis, could well copy the resulting upswing should support hold.
“As long as price keeps consolidating near the range low, I still think this scenario has a decent chance to play out,” the analysis read. 
“We've seen this during every consolidation this cycle where it breaks lower, fails to see continuation, retakes the range and moves higher from there. Let's see how this one turns out. That ~$90K level remains key.”

Order book liquidation levels meanwhile formed the basis for a bullish thesis by fellow trader TheKingfisher.
“Liquidation map for $BTC shows MASSIVE short liquidations clustered between 90k-94k!” he reported alongside data from global exchange Binance.
“Below, longs get liquidated around 85k-87k. Expect volatility!”

Popular trader Patric H. added $92,500 as a key level to reclaim.

Why is Solana (SOL) price down today?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-solana-sol-price-down-today,2025-03-07,"Solana
SOL
$125.45
has dropped by 7.50% in the last 24 hours to reach around $142 on March 7, mirroring losses across the cryptocurrency market.
SOL/USD four-hour price chart. Source: TradingView
Top reasons driving the SOL prices lower today include:
An underwhelming crypto executive order by US President Donald Trump.
Negative funding rates.
A descending channel pattern.
Digital Asset Stockpile fails to impress SOL bulls
Solana’s price tumbled today as crypto markets reacted to President Donald Trump’s executive order establishing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile.
What to know:
Investors had expected the US government would actively purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but the order specified no new acquisitions beyond assets already forfeited.
Trump fulfilled his campaign promise to establish a Bitcoin reserve, but it will be comprised of BTC already owned by the federal government.
The Treasury and Commerce Secretaries may explore “budget-neutral strategies” to acquire more Bitcoin in the future—but without using taxpayer funds.
The broader Digital Asset Stockpile focusing on altcoins will not include any purchasing of new tokens.
The US holds approximately $17.7 billion in Bitcoin and $400 million in seven other tokens, mostly seized from civil and criminal cases.
The government has not revealed any SOL holdings so far, with analysts noting that the amount they hold is likely to be “pretty minuscule.”

Solana’s funding rates flip negative
Solana's open interest (OI) is decreasing, and its funding rates are negative, which provides insight into why SOL’s price is struggling.
Key points:
Solana’s OI in the futures market has dripped from its local peak of $8.57 billion on Jan. 17 to $4.03 billion as of March 7.
OI measures the total number of outstanding futures contracts, and a decrease suggests more traders are exiting positions.

A declining OI typically means reduced speculative demand, slowing upward price momentum.
SOL’s weekly funding rates dropped to -0.20% on March 7, three months after peaking out at 1.37%.
SOL OI-Weighted Funding Rate. Source: CoinGlass
Negative funding means shorts are paying longs to keep their positions open.
OI decline and negative funding rates show a lack of confidence in SOL’s short-term price action.
Solana price eyes another 25% drop
SOL has fallen by more than 50% since establishing its record high of around $295.30 in January — and it appears there’s more room to decline in the coming weeks.
Key points:
SOL price is correcting inside what appears to be a falling wedge, a classic bullish reversal pattern, but confirmation is needed.
$106, down 25% from the current price levels, appears to be a key downside target for Solana.
The level aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement, 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA; the blue wave), and wedge apex.
SOL/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 42.03 signals further downside potential before reaching oversold conditions.
Trading volume remains weak, indicating lower buying interest.
A break above the wedge’s upper trendline may weaken SOL’s risks of declining toward $106, instead sending the price to a level at a length equal to the wedge’s height.

On the other hand, SOL could retest $265 if it breaks above the wedge’s upper trendline in the coming days.

Bitcoin analysts predict limited upside after BTC reserve disappointment,https://cointelegraph.com/news/https-cms-cointelegraph-com-articles-18718-language-1,2025-03-07,"Bitcoin analysts are signaling limited upside potential for the cryptocurrency following disappointment over US President Donald Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve plan, which did not involve direct government purchases of Bitcoin, contrary to some expectations.
Trump’s executive order, signed on March 7, outlined a plan to create a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases rather than actively acquiring Bitcoin

Bitcoin’s price action may lack any significant upside due to this initial investor disappointment, according to Bitfinex analysts, who told Cointelegraph:
“After initial disappointment with the announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, we expect more rangebound trading as the US will not be making new purchases, and instead is simply introducing a plausible framework to hold seized crypto assets.”
Still, other analysts see the US Bitcoin reserve plan as the first “real step” for Bitcoin’s integration into the global financial system.
“The US has taken its first real step toward integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance, acknowledging its role as a foundational asset for a more stable and sound monetary system,” Joe Burnett, head of market research at Unchained, told Cointelegraph.

Analysts debate long-term BTC impact
Despite the short-term investor disappointment, Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plans may prove to be a viable middle ground to start experimenting with Bitcoin as a national reserve asset.
This “softer approach” may be more viable and meet less mainstream resistance, according to Bitfinex Analysts, who added:
“This approach follows the possible realization in the White House that creating a fund to invest in cryptocurrencies might be met with a lot of resistance and hence the choice of a more viable and somewhat softer approach to adopting crypto assets.”

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD recovering from local lows of $84,713 on Bitstamp.
These came as US President Donald Trump signed a long-awaited executive order establishing the reserve, which will consist of no “new” BTC; only confiscated coins will form the stockpile.
“Premature sales of bitcoin have already cost US taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings,” David Sacks, the White House crypto czar, wrote in part of a post on X.
“The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers.”

Markets initially fell swiftly on the event as bulls’ hopes for additional BTC acquisitions vanished.
“For what it’s worth, this is not the ‘reserve’ that crypto bulls had in mind,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter explained in an X reaction. 
“A clear sell the news event with expectations not being met.”
The subsequent Asia trading session nonetheless witnessed renewed strength ahead of the White House Crypto Summit set for later.
Longtime industry commentators saw little reason for cold feet given the overall stance of the new US government on crypto.
“I still don’t understand how people fail to distinguish between bullish and non-bullish news,” analyst BitQuant said. 
“I can't recall a time when Bitcoin was more bullish, yet they still manage to manipulate you into panicking at the bottom.”
Charles Edwards, founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, described the market as “excessively short” at the sub-$85,000 lows.
“Bitcoin always overreacts on news, both up and down,” he contended.

A raft of US employment data was due on March 7, along with a speech by Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve.
A week after the Fed’s “preferred” inflation gauge arrived in line with expectations, markets have been gradually increasing their expectations over the number of interest rate cuts occurring this year.
The latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool showed 11% odds of a cut at the Fed’s March meeting, and much higher for its May meeting — almost 50%.

Key takeaways:
Bitcoin’s drawdown follows US President Donald Trump’s announcement for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.
More outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs.
Bitcoin price must hold above a key support area to avoid a deeper correction.
Bitcoin Strategic Reserve falls short of expectations
Bitcoin and the collective crypto market reacted negatively to US President Trump’s directive to establish a Bitcoin reserve and set up a separate crypto stockpile.
Key takeaways:
On March 7, the US President signed an executive order creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.
Market participants expected the government to announce a plan to buy more Bitcoin using taxpayer funds or Treasury resources.
Rather, the reserve will consist of BTC already seized by the government, as per Trump’s crypto Czar David Sacks. 
In a March 7 post on X Sacks said:
“The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime.”
However, the government will develop strategies to acquire more BTC via budget-neutral strategies.
Nevertheless, this dampened hopes of immediate fresh capital inflows into the Bitcoin market.
This conservative approach disappointed traders who had anticipated a more bullish catalyst, such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January of last year.
Bitcoin responded to these developments with an 8.7% drop in price from a high of $92,790 on March 6 to an intraday low of $84,700 on March 7.

“Bitcoin falls sharply after President Trump signs Executive Order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” said capital markets commentator The Kobeissi Letter.
“This is because there is no explanation on how the reserve will be funded aside from Bitcoin already held by the US. It’s simply a promise to not sell what they currently hold.”
Spot Bitcoin ETFs down $3.8B in two weeks
Massive outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs have preceded the sluggish performance of BTC over the last 24 hours.
Key points: 
Bitcoin's sharp bearish price movement over the last 14 days dampened demand for spot ETFs, driving total outflows to approximately $3.87 billion. 
On Feb. 25, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a massive $1.14 billion in outflows, the largest single-day withdrawal since the ETFs were introduced.
These investment products saw $134.3 million in outflows on March 6.

Alva, a crypto insights firm, blamed the outflows on March 6 on the “buzz around Trump’s US Crypto Strategic Reserve proposal,” adding:
”Investors are jittery about decentralization. Major players like Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK’s ARKB are feeling the heat with big withdrawals, signaling market trepidation.”

BTC price needs to hold above 200 EMA
On March 3, Bitcoin price fell toward the critical support provided by the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) currently at $85,550.

Key levels to watch:
Holding above this trendline would enable Bitcoin to possibly recover above a major resistance zone between $92,800 (100-day EMA) and $94,000 (50-day EMA).
If this happens, BTC price would be well-positioned to retest the $100,000 level and likely confirm $78K as the local bottom.

As such, a daily candlestick close below the 200-day EMA could see BTC price drop toward an area of interest between $81,500 (March 4 low) and $78,200 (Feb. 28 low).
Commenting on Bitcoin’s price action ahead of the White House Crypto Summit, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades pointed out the key levels to watch in both directions, including the range low at $90,800 and the all-time high at $109,000.

Bitcoin has ‘more than 50% chance’ of new high by June: Cory Klippsten,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-odds-hitting-new-highs-by-june-2025-swan-bitcoin-cory-klippsten,2025-03-07,"The chances of Bitcoin surpassing its all-time high of $109,000 by June are favorable, but the market first needs time to absorb volatile macroeconomic conditions, says Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten.
“I think there’s more than 50% chance we will see all-time highs before the end of June this year,” Klippsten told Cointelegraph. 
However, he said that market participants first need to adapt to US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and the uncertainty around inflation rates.
Markets need time to digest
“The market needs to first digest tariffs, trade war fears, and growth scare fears. Bitcoin trading below $100,000 right now feels like a pause, not an end to the bull run,” he said.
At the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading at $88,210, down 4.9% over the last day, CoinMarketCap data shows. Bitcoin has dropped almost 14% since Trump announced import tariffs on goods from China, Canada, and Mexico on Feb. 1.

Klippsten said Bitcoin’s momentum from its first-ever break above $100,000 in December 2024 hasn’t “entirely faded,” and institutional demand “hasn’t gone away.”
“The macroeconomic uncertainty — geopolitical tensions, inflation fears, and Fed policy shifts — is definitely creating noise, but I’d argue it’s mostly short-term.”
“We’re in a consolidation phase now, but I don’t see it stretching into long-term sideways movement,” Klippsten said.
After Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $73,679 in March, it consolidated within a broad range of $53,000 to $72,000 for the next eight months. It then reclaimed that level after Trump was elected in November and surged to $100,000 the following month.
Bitcoin may bounce between $85,000 to $95,000 for some time
Bitcoin dropped to a low of under $85,000 shortly after Trump signed an executive order creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. 
Trump’s order fell short of market expectations as it only confirmed that most Bitcoin held by the US government would not be sold and didn’t give a clear timeline as to when it would acquire more, nor how much it was looking to buy.
Related: Bitcoin price metric that called 2020 bull run says $69K new bottom
Following Bitcoin’s price slide, network economist Timothy Peterson told Cointelegraph that based on historical patterns, it is likely that Bitcoin will bounce between $85,000 and $95,000 over the next six to twelve weeks before “slowly” trending up to over $100,000 again.
Bitwise Invest CEO Hunter Horsley isn’t overly concerned by Bitcoin’s price drop following the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve announcement, pointing out that a similar drop occurred after the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024.
“Bitcoin sold off on Bitcoin ETFs launching. And then went on to a new ATH. Traders gonna trade,” Horsley said in a March 7 X post.

Bitcoin plunges 6% as Trump’s crypto reserve falls short of hopes,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-plunges-trump-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-eo,2025-03-07,"Bitcoin plunged approximately 6% after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

US crypto reserve could boost Bitcoin market cap by $460B — Research,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-crypto-reserve-could-boost-bitcoin-market-cap-by-460-b-research,2025-03-07,"Creating a strategic cryptocurrency reserve in the United States could boost Bitcoin’s
BTC

market capitalization by roughly 25%, or approximately $460 billion, according to an analysis by Sygnum Bank shared with Cointelegraph. 
US President Donald Trump’s plans for a national crypto stockpile, along with similar proposals across dozens of US states, could trigger a multibillion-dollar buying spree with a 20x multiplier effect on Bitcoin’s price, according to Sygnum, a crypto asset manager.
“Because the liquid supply of bitcoin is very small […] larger inflows cause upward price shocks,” Katalin Tischhauser, Sygnum’s research head, told Cointelegraph. 
Tischhauser added that federal or state government Bitcoin buying would be “likely to trigger another wave of allocations from institutional investors as well,” not to mention other countries’ governments. 
Institutional capital flows are already exerting a “multiplier effect” on BTC’s spot price, with every $1 billion worth of net inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) driving an approximately 3-6% price move, Sygnum said in its Crypto Market Outlook 2025 report.

On March 2, Trump confirmed his commitment to creating a US crypto stockpile holding Bitcoin, as well as altcoins such as Ether
ETH
$1,899
and Solana
SOL
$125.42
, among others.
Crypto markets surged following Trump’s announcements but surrendered those gains later in the week as macroeconomic unease and a looming trade war took center stage. 
Trump has endorsed the idea of a national crypto pool since July 2024, when US Senator Cynthia Lummis pitched the BITCOIN Act, proposing a US reserve specifically for Bitcoin. More than half of US states have fielded proposals to create similar reserves at a state-level.

However, progress has been uneven. Five states already rejected crypto reserve plans, Tischhauser said. Meanwhile, creating a federal crypto stockpile would presumably require Congressional approval, a lengthy and uncertain process. 
“[T]he market currently rates the probability [of a national Bitcoin stockpile] relatively low” because of challenges including confusing messaging and legal hurdles, Katalin Tischhauser, Sygnum’s research head, told Cointelegraph. 
“[A]ny positive surprise would be bullish for the bitcoin price,” Tischhauser said. 
The White House intends to reveal more details about the plans during a March 7 crypto summit, according to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. 
He suggested that Bitcoin will have a special status in the US crypto reserve, which will include ETH, Solana, XRP

“That level of support coming from the administration is bullish for sure but calling it a strategic reserve has created a lot of confusion,” Tischhauser said.

Bitcoin price rebound breaks down before key level is hit — Here is why,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-rebound-breaks-down-before-key-level-is-hit-here-is-why,2025-03-07,"Bitcoin gained 6.8% between March 5 and March 6, briefly reclaiming $92,000. However, the trend reversed after the S&P 500 fell 1.3%, triggered by a warning from Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker about the US economy. Other factors also kept Bitcoin’s price below $95,000, such as rising tensions in Ukraine and uncertainty over potential US digital asset strategic reserves.

Philadelphia Fed president Harker said there is growing evidence that the consumer sector is “under stress,” especially for lower-income groups, according to YahooFinance. Harker backed a “pragmatist” approach for the US central bank “in this environment of uncertainty” while adding that price pressures will “continue to retreat.” Harker’s comments suggest support for bigger rate cuts by the Fed, but they do not signal strength for the economy.
Traders increase cash and cash-equivalent positions when they fear an economic recession, regardless of whether the causes are socio-political, such as the conflict in Ukraine, or centered on the outlook for the artificial intelligence sector. For Bitcoin to break above $95,000, a scenario of reduced uncertainty is required, even if the outcome is higher inflation, which is inherently positive for scarce assets—given the impact on fixed-income instruments.

The escalating war tensions and fears of a recession, fueled by the tariff dispute, pushed the S&P 500 volatility index (VIX) to its highest levels in 11 weeks. This indicates that investors are more risk-averse than usual. Historically, under such conditions, Bitcoin has performed poorly, at least in the days immediately following local peaks in the VIX indicator.

Currently, at 24, the S&P 500 volatility index is significantly higher than its level of 16 two weeks ago and is now closer to its highest point in 7 months. However, a likely consequence of worsening economic conditions is an expansion of the monetary base, as central banks are compelled to stimulate their economies.
On March 6, China hinted at having “more room to act on fiscal policy amid domestic and external uncertainties,” while the European Central Bank stated that monetary policy is becoming “meaningfully less restrictive.”
History has repeatedly shown that an increase in money circulation is highly favorable for Bitcoin, whether it is viewed as a risk-on asset or a hedge instrument. Lyn Alden, a macroeconomics analyst, noted that Bitcoin moves in the “direction of global liquidity 83% of the time in any given 12-month period, which is higher than any other major asset class.”
However, Lyn Alden’s research highlights that Bitcoin is not immune to short-term volatility driven by “idiosyncratic events or internal market dynamics,” as seen with the speculation surrounding the US digital asset strategic reserve. For Bitcoin to regain its bullish momentum, investors are anticipating a clear resolution from the upcoming Crypto Summit organized by the Trump administration.

If Trump’s plans merely involve halting sales of the government’s current Bitcoin holdings from administrative seizures, for example, this would likely be interpreted negatively by traders. Even if it becomes clear that any Bitcoin purchases depend on Congressional approval, this would still allow investors to reassess the potential upside, as it provides clarity on Trump’s expectations and plans.
Additionally, a positive outcome from the March 7 Crypto Summit could encourage other countries and listed companies to explore Bitcoin as a reserve asset, potentially paving the way for a sustained bull run toward $95,000 and beyond.

Total crypto market cap could top $4 trillion in Q2 — Analyst,https://cointelegraph.com/news/total-crypto-market-cap-could-top-4-trillion-in-q2-analyst,2025-03-07,"The total crypto market capitalization reached a new all-time high of $3.73 trillion on Dec. 14, 2024, but since then, the metric has dropped 21% to $2.91 trillion. 
Despite the current drawdown, one analyst believes the metric could reach new highs in Q2 2025.
Total market cap and global liquidity index are correlated
Mark Quant, a crypto markets researcher, presented a study that indicated that a rising Global Liquidity Index (GLI) could pave the recovery path for the crypto market, potentially pushing the total crypto market cap to new all-time highs above $4 trillion in the second quarter of 2025. 
The Global Liquidity Index (GLI) measures the ease of financing in global financial markets, and it can be utilized as a metric to understand global financial conditions.
When GLI rises, it indicates that investors have access to more capital, which boosts risk on assets such as crypto.

As illustrated in the chart, Quant explained that the GLI and the TOTAL market cap carried a strong 0.77 correlation with a 74-day offset. With the GLI being the leading indicator, its expansion often led to a bullish trend in cryptocurrencies. While the market might move sideways over the next 30 days, the analyst predicted early April could begin a bullish rally. Quant said,
“Once liquidity is fully priced in, $TOTAL could exceed the $4T market cap, aligning with previous liquidity-driven cycles.”
On a broader scale, Quant’s analysis draws similarities to Lyn Alden’s research from September 2024. The research piece “Bitcoin: A Global Liquidity Barometer” mentioned that Bitcoin moved 83% of the time toward global liquidity in any given 12-month period.

Compared to other major asset classes such as SPX, GOLD and VT, Bitcoin’s correlation with global liquidity is the highest. Yet, the crypto asset was exposed to short-term deviations from time to time by “idiosyncratic events or internal market dynamics.”

Is the crypto market bottom in?
Although the TOTAL market cap has been down 20% over the past 3 months, Dom, a market analyst, said it was currently testing its previous cycle 2021 high and a March 2024 high as support.
The analyst explained that the yearly relative volume weight average price or rVWAP sat right below the current market cap, which added further support to its market structure.
Dom said, 
“This is very clear on this monthly chart and adds to the idea that acceptance under current monthly lows would break the bull market.”
Similarly, Daan Crypto, a crypto trader, highlighted that the current weekly close would be important from a bullish perspective. Currently, the TOTAL crypto market cap remains under its 2021 highs, which means there is bearish acceptance seeking dominance in the high time frame chart.

Bitcoin shrugs off Crypto Summit excitement
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD trading down 2% on the day.
A run to local highs near $93,000 ended in rejection earlier as bulls lacked the strength to take price action further into its old trading range.
Despite the Crypto Summit being only a day away and promising bullish announcements involving a Bitcoin or crypto reserve, markets showed little interest or optimism as traders stayed cautious.
Justin Bennett, who previously predicted that Bitcoin would retest its multimonth floor at $78,000, was among them.
“There’s the retest of $92k resistance. It worked so well the first time bulls wanted to do it again,” he wrote in part of a post on X, revealing a short BTC position from $91,000.

“Even as inflation has rebounded, rates are falling in anticipation of DOGE's economic impact. Rate cut odds are rising.”

, several critics slammed the idea of adding centralized altcoins alongside Bitcoin in the reserve. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified in an interview with The Pavlovic Today that Bitcoin is likely to have a special status in the nation’s crypto reserve.

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said in a March 5 market note that the US crypto reserve “will be nearly entirely Bitcoin, and it will be larger than people think.” He added that similar announcements in other countries will likely follow a US crypto reserve.
The cryptocurrencies proposed to be included in the crypto reserve surged after the announcement but then gave back a large part of their gains. Their weekly charts have been analyzed to avoid the near-term noise. That will help in understanding the levels at which a trending move begins.
Bitcoin price analysis
Bitcoin price rebounded from its recent sell-off, and a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to close below the 20-week exponential moving average ($90,664). This shows that the bulls are active at lower levels.
BTC/USDT weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The bulls will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the psychological barrier at $100,000. If they manage to do that, it will clear the path for a retest of the all-time high at $109,588. The sellers will try to defend the $109,588 level, but if the bulls prevail, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $138,000.
Contrary to this assumption, if the price fails to hold above $100,000, it will suggest that the bears are trying to form a lower high. The pair could then descend to the 50-week simple moving average ($75,543).
Ether price analysis
Ether has formed a large range between $2,111 and $4,094. The price slipped below $2,000 recently, but the long tail on the candlestick shows buying at lower levels.

A weak rebound off the $2,111 level suggests that demand is drying up. That increases the risk of a breakdown below $2,111. If that happens, it will indicate that the ETH/USDT pair may have topped out in the near term. The pair may start a downtrend to $1,500 and then to $1,075.
Buyers will have to push and sustain the price above the moving averages to signal that the range-bound action remains intact. The pair may then climb to the top of the range at $4,094. This is a critical overhead resistance for the bears to defend because a break above it could clear the path for a rally to $4,868 and eventually to the target objective of $6,077.
XRP price analysis
XRP has been consolidating in an uptrend. After a vertical rally, the price generally takes a breather before starting the next trending move.
XRP/USDT weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The XRP/USDT pair has been oscillating between $2 and $3 for several weeks, indicating a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. Sellers are defending the overhead resistance while the bulls are buying near the support. The longer the price remains inside the range, the stronger the eventual breakout from it.
A break and close above $3 will be the first indication that the range has resolved in favor of the bulls. That opens the doors for a possible rally to $4 and then $5. Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below $2, it will indicate that the pair has topped out in the medium term. That heightens the risk of a fall to $1.50.

Solana price analysis
Solana made a new all-time high on Jan. 19, but that proved to be a bull trap. The price has since been in a firm correction, indicating selling by traders.
SOL/USDT weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The bulls are expected to fiercely defend the $120 to $110 support zone. If they succeed, it will suggest that $110 is the new floor. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will sell on rallies to the 20-week EMA ($190). If the price turns down from the 20-week EMA, the pair may drop to $110 and swing between these two levels for a few weeks. A break and close below $110 could sink the pair to $80.
The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-week EMA. There is resistance at $205, but it is likely to be crossed. If that happens, the SOL/USDT pair could rally to $260, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. Buyers will have to achieve a strong close above $260 to signal the start of a new uptrend. 
Cardano price analysis
Cardano has been pinned below the $1.25 level since early 2022, but a minor positive is that the bulls are trying to make a comeback. 
ADA/USDT weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
If buyers drive the price above $1.25, the ADA/USDT pair could pick up momentum. Usually, when the price breaks out of a large basing formation, it leads to strong uptrends. The pair may face minor resistance at $1.64, but it is likely to be crossed. The pair could then climb to $2.38.
Alternatively, if the price stays below $1.25, select short-term traders who may have bought at lower levels could be tempted to book profits. That could pull the price to the 50-week SMA ($0.59), which is a necessary support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 50-week SMA with strength, the bulls will try to push the pair toward $1.25. The pair may then remain range-bound between the 50-week SMA and $1.25 for a while.

Solana DEX volumes still rival Ethereum’s despite memecoin meltdown: VanEck,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-dex-volumes-still-rival-ethereum-s-despite-memecoin-meltdown-van-eck,2025-03-07,"Solana’s decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes still rival those of the entire Ethereum ecosystem despite a steep dropoff in memecoin trading activity, asset manager VanEck said. 
In February, Solana’s share of total onchain DEX volume topped 43%, briefly surpassing the combined DEX volume of Ethereum and its layer-2 scaling networks, according to a March 5 report by VanEck. 
They declined to around 30% in March, slightly below the Ethereum ecosystem’s roughly 40% share, data shows. 
“Despite the Memecoin Meltdown, Solana DEX volumes are still holding their own — roughly matching the entire ETH ecosystem (L1 + L2s),” Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of research, said in a post on the X platform.

Memecoin tumult
Activity on the Solana network declined in February after a series of memecoin-related scandals soured sentiment among retail traders. 
‘[T]he impact was severe, with stablecoin transfers — the backbone of on-chain trading — plummeting (-80%) from January levels,” VanEck said. 
On Feb. 14, Libra, a memecoin seemingly endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei, erased some $4.4 billion in market capitalization within hours of launching.
Since January, traders have lost approximately $2 billion across 800,000 wallets on Official Trump (TRUMP), US President Donald Trump’s official memecoin.
Memecoin trading, largely tied to the popular Pump.fun platform, comprises roughly 80% of the Solana blockchain network’s revenues, according to the report.
New token launches on Pump.fun are down more than 80% since January. Memecoins bootstrap liquidity on Pump.fun before graduating to Raydium, Solana’s most popular DEX.
As of March 6, Raydium has more than $1.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama.
“Solana has been the standout performer in the current crypto market cycle, with its token price rising (+191%), on-chain revenues (excluding MEV) surging (+700%), and stablecoin supply increasing (+291%) in 2024,” VanEck said. 
“One of the biggest drivers of Solana’s growth has been memecoin trading,” VanEck added, noting that Pump.fun generated more than $577 million in fees in just over a year.

Litecoin traders say LTC price dips below $100 are ‘accumulation’ opportunities,https://cointelegraph.com/news/litecoin-traders-say-ltc-price-dips-below-100-are-accumulation-opportunities,2025-03-07,"After a period of outperformance against major crypto assets, Litecoin’s

 price dropped as low as $94, a 26% fall from the weekly open.
While the trade wars between the US, Canada, China, and Mexico continue to pressure the crypto market, multiple analysts have pointed out a potential opportunity in Litecoin. 
Litecoin dip follows “overly bullish commentary” in February
In February, LTC was one of the few altcoins that exhibited price dominance against BTC. Litecoin remained at breakeven value for the month, while Bitcoin faced an 18% drop. Litecoin’s resilience led to positive social commentary surrounding the crypto asset, which was largely dominated by the spot LTC ETF filings.

Santiment data pointed out these developments and identified an increase in LTC active addresses to 445,000 over the month.
Irrespective of the current market structure, Valeriya, a crypto and Forex trader, stated that Litecoin displays “signs of reaccumulation.” The trader added,

Key Litecoin levels to hold under $100
From a technical perspective, Litecoin trades in a higher consolidation range, where the overhead resistance range of $130 to $140 remains unbreached.
The daily chart shows that the price has remained above the 200-day exponential moving average (200D-EMA) since Nov. 6, 2024. A break below the 200D-EMA might indicate the early signs of a high time frame (HTF) bearish shift.

Under those circumstances, the immediate support for Litecoin remains between $92 to $100 and $80-$88. As illustrated in the chart, LTC retested support range 1 ($92 to $100) on March 4 before immediately recovering above the 200D-EMA.
The relative strength index (RSI) also dropped to 38, its lowest value since Aug. 8, 2024, deviating below a 7-month low. 
Data from IntoTheBlock added more onchain confluence to the support ranges defined in the chart. Between $79 and $90, a total of 6.86 million LTC tokens were held by 1.73 million addresses, while 1.11 million addresses held 17.84 million LTC tokens in the $90 to $108 range.

Thus, in terms of trading volume, $108 and $90 is the immediate support range, while more holders are between $79 and $90.

Bitwise makes first institutional DeFi allocation,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitwise-makes-first-institutional-defi-allocation,2025-03-07,"Bitwise Asset Management has made its first institutional decentralized finance (DeFi) allocation, depositing into Maple Finance’s overcollateralized Bitcoin loans, Maple told Cointelegraph on March 6. 
Maple did not disclose the size of the investment but confirmed that Bitwise’s allocation is represented in Dune Analytics total value locked (TVL) figures for Maple’s “blue chip secured” strategy. 
Those figures show a roughly $5 million increase in Maple’s TVL between March 4 and March 5. 
Bitwise’s investment is “a testament to the maturity and readiness of on-chain lending infrastructure,” Maple’s CEO, Sid Powell, said in a statement. 
The allocation “signals a broader shift as institutional capital moves beyond conventional fixed income toward more efficient and scalable on-chain lending markets,” Bitwise and Maple said.

Institutional investors in the US are cautiously forraying into DeFi now that President Donald Trump has taken office. Trump has promised to make America the “world’s crypto capital” and nominated industry-friendly leadership to key regulatory agencies. 
“We’ve always sought to take advantage of crypto-native investments that generate dynamic, uncorrelated returns,” Jeff Park, Bitwise’s head of alpha strategies, said in a statement. 
Park added that Bitwise is keen to capitalize on the “emerging opportunity in on-chain credit.”

New York bill aims to protect crypto investors from memecoin rug pulls,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ny-bill-criminalize-crypto-fraud-rug-pulls-amid-memecoin-scandals,2025-03-06,"New York lawmakers have introduced legislation aimed at protecting cryptocurrency investors by targeting rug pull scams, where project insiders abruptly abandon a project and drain investor funds.
Assemblymember Clyde Vanel, chair of the New York Assembly’s Banks Committee, introduced Bill A06515 on March 5. The bill would establish criminal penalties specifically aimed at preventing cryptocurrency fraud and protecting investors from rug pulls.
Under the proposal, new criminal charges would be created for offenses involving “virtual token fraud,” explicitly targeting deceptive practices associated with cryptocurrencies.

“Virtual tokens” refer to security tokens and stablecoins, while “security tokens” include “any form of fungible and non-fungible computer code by which all such forms of ownership of said computer code is determined through verification of transactions or any derivative method, and that is stored on a peer-to-peer computer network.”

The bill comes shortly after the space began experiencing widespread investor disappointment in memecoins, particularly after the launch of the Libra token, which was endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei.
The Libra project’s insiders allegedly siphoned over $107 million worth of liquidity in a rug pull, triggering a 94% price collapse within hours and wiping out $4 billion in investor capital.

The growing wave of Solana-based memecoin scams led to a crypto capital flight to “safety,” which resulted in over $485 million in outflows for Solana during February.

Rug pulls “should fall firmly within the jurisdiction of law enforcement”
The rise of memecoin-related scams presents significant regulatory challenges, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum.
Insider scams and “outright fraudulent activities” like rug pulls, which are “not only unethical but also clearly illegal, with case law to support enforcement,” should see more thorough regulatory attention, Plotnikova told Cointelegraph. She added:
“In my view, these activities should fall firmly within the jurisdiction of law enforcement agencies.” 
More troubling revelations have emerged since the meltdown of the Milei-endorsed Libra token, notably that Libra was an “open secret” in memecoin insider circles and that some members of the Jupiter decentralized exchange knew about the token launch two weeks in advance.

Bitcoin struggles near $90K as US tariff fears spook ETF investors,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-limited-etf-institutional-investment-tariff-concerns,2025-03-06,"Bitcoin’s recent rally above the key psychological threshold of $90,000 proved short-lived, with analysts pointing to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and a significant reduction in institutional investments in cryptocurrency markets.
Bitcoin (BTC) staged a near 10% recovery to above $95,000 on March 2 before forming a double-top chart pattern around $94,200 on the daily chart, a setup that indicates an imminent price decline.
Bitcoin bottomed at around $81,400 the following day and has since been struggling to remain above the $90,000 mark, TradingView data shows.

Multiple factors are contributing to the Bitcoin slump, including US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.
The analyst told Cointelegraph:
“Significant outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs have amplified selling pressure, as institutional investors pulled back, likely reacting to macroeconomic uncertainties and shifting risk sentiment.”
The US spot Bitcoin ETFs are seeing their fourth consecutive week of net negative outflows after recording over $2.6 billion worth of cumulative net outflows during the last week of February, Sosovalue data shows.

Beyond ETF inflows, macroeconomic factors are also pressuring Bitcoin’s price action, Lee said, adding:
“New tariff announcements from President Trump have heightened concerns about inflation and economic stability, prompting investors to favor safer assets over risk-on investments like Bitcoin.”
Still, analysts remained optimistic about Bitcoin’s price trajectory for late 2025, with price predictions ranging from $160,000 to above $180,000.

US tariff concerns may be alleviated next week
Some of the concerns related to a potential global trade war may be alleviated with next week’s announcements, according to Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset investment platform Nexo.
The implementation of US tariffs has “weighed in” on crypto markets after going into effect, leading to declines in digital assets and traditional equities, the analyst said, adding:
“However, long-term optimism won over short-term unease after US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that a deal to reduce tariffs on Canada and Mexico could be announced as early as Wednesday.”
Related: Bitcoin price risks correction to $72K as investor sentiment weakens
Trade policy uncertainty will likely “keep sentiment guarded” while the increased likelihood of Federal Reserve rate cuts may “suggest a potential turnaround” for crypto markets, added the analyst.
Meanwhile, the wider crypto market is still recovering from the $1.4 billion Bybit hack on Feb. 21, marking the largest hack in crypto history.

Ethereum most 'undervalued' in 17-months — Can ETH return to $4K?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-most-undervalued-in-17-months-eth-return-4k,2025-03-06,"Ethereum’s MVRV Z-Score, a key metric for assessing whether its native token, Ether , is overvalued or undervalued, has dropped to its lowest level in 17 months, signaling that the second-largest cryptocurrency may be bottoming.
Ethereum’s MVRV Z-Score nears accumulation zone
The MVRV Z-Score, which compares Ethereum’s market value to its realized value, is now close to the green zone, historically associated with undervaluation. This metric suggests that ETH may be trading at a discount relative to the total capital inflow into the network.

The last time the MVRV Z-Score hit such low levels was in October 2023, just before ETH rebounded by almost 160% in the following months toward the $4,000 milestone. Similarly, the score’s dip to the green zone in December 2022 and March 2020 preceded historic bull runs.
Furthermore, CryptoQuant data shows that daily ETH inflows into accumulation addresses have spiked to their highest level in years, surpassing previous accumulation phases seen before major bull runs.

This suggests that institutional investors and long-term holders are aggressively accumulating ETH while its MVRV Z-Score remains undervalued. Ethereum’s onchain data tracking whale addresses echoes this, too.
Notably, Ethereum whales holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have been aggressively accumulating over since July 2024, when multiple Ether-specific spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) went live for the first time in the US.

Most of the accumulation trend period coincides with Ether’s price pullback, indicating that these whales are buying the dip. In other words, large investors anticipate ETH price will increase in 2025.

Can ETH price reclaim $4,000?
As of March 6, ETH is trading near $2,291, testing the lower trendline support of the symmetrical triangle and the 200-week EMA ($2,294).
This support confluence is reinforcing the possibility of a strong rebound from current levels. Historically, similar confluences have preceded major trend reversals, setting the stage for a rally toward the triangle’s upper trendline at around $3,650.
ETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView
Ethereum’s price action aligns with key Fibonacci retracement levels, adding further confluence to a potential bullish breakout.
The 0.382 Fib level (~$2,518) is a key hurdle for bulls, with a successful reclaim opening the door toward $3,000 (0.5 Fib) and eventually $3,420 (0.618 Fib) — a historical resistance zone.
A breakout beyond these levels should set up ETH for a retest of $4,063 (0.786 Fib) near the triangle’s upper boundary.

Conversely, a decisive break below the triangle’s lower trendline may invalidate the rebound setup overall. Instead, ETH’s price will risk declining toward $1,050, aligning with the 0.0 Fibonacci retracement line.

Let’s look at the top catalysts driving the crypto market rebound today.
Bitcoin leads rebound amid Trump’s auto tariffs delay
Today’s crypto market’s recovery aligns closely with similar rebounds in the US stock market, as Donald Trump’s tariff delay eased investor worries, with Bitcoin leading the market higher.
What to know:
On March 5, US President Donald Trump temporarily paused the proposed 25% tariffs on auto imports from Canada and Mexico. 
Initially confirmed earlier this week, these tariffs had sparked fears of a trade war, rattling global financial markets and dragging down risk assets like cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin, for instance, dipped below $90,000 on March 3 amid this uncertainty. 
However, following negotiations with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump agreed to a 30-day delay, easing tensions. 
This reprieve has spurred a risk-on sentiment, with Bitcoin climbing back above $92,000 and Ether edging above $2,300. 
Analysts suggest that averting immediate trade disruptions has reduced macroeconomic pressure, allowing crypto—a sector sensitive to such shifts—to recover and rally.

Risk-on sentiment boosts crypto market
The ongoing crypto rally mirrors the strength witnessed in US equities.
The broad-market S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq also rose by 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively, during the late New York trading session on March 5. 
Crypto-related stocks also climbed higher, with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) rising by 4.5% and Strategy (MSTR) gaining nearly 12%.

The US dollar index (DXY) is at its weakest level since early November and is down more than 5.5% lower from its Jan. 13 peak of 110.17. 
Fed rate expectations are shifting back to pricing more rate cuts in 2025, with market participants betting on 52% chances of a 25 basis point rate cut in June.

“Looking at the trend, sentiment appears to be shifting towards more easing, possibly driven by economic data, inflation trends, and Fed commentary, market commentator Walter Bloomberg said in a March 5 post on X.
“The market initially priced in fewer cuts but has now surged higher—will the Fed follow through?”

Crypto market technical rebound
From a technical perspective, today's crypto market’s gains are part of a rebound that started at a support confluence comprising the psychological level at $2.80 trillion and the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).
TOTAL crypto market cap. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The total market cap, currently at $2.95 trillion, seeks to break above the resistance zone between $3.1 trillion and $3.28 trillion, where both the 100-day and 50-day SMAs sit.
If this happens, it would signal a bullish breakout from the current downtrend phase, with bulls targeting all-time highs above $3.69 trillion. 
The daily relative strength index, or RSI, has jumped from oversold conditions at 25 on Feb. 20 to the current value of 47, suggesting the bullish momentum is building up.

March 7 will see US President Donald Trump host the first White House Crypto Summit, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggesting that the event should yield confirmation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

“The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is coming,” Professional Capital Management founder and CEO Anthony Pompliano summarized on X. 
“Everyone wants digital sound money.”
In a market note on March 5, Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at crypto index fund and ETF manager Bitwise, forecasted that the reserve would go ahead and consist “entirely” of BTC.

Other traders are confused. “No one has any idea what the hell is going on,” pseudonymous crypto trader Mandrik said.
Market participants have mixed views on Bitcoin’s direction
Some say the upcoming US Crypto Summit will be a key factor in determining Bitcoin’s short-term performance. “People are unsure and waiting to see what happens next, e.g. US Crypto Summit,” crypto commentator Bitcoin Malaya said on March 5.
The White House Crypto Summit is scheduled for March 7 and is expected to include more than 25 participants, including members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets.
It comes after a turbulent period for Bitcoin, which fell below $80,000 on Feb. 28 for the first time since November, following Trump’s tariff threats on Europe.

Falling US dollar is signaling a strong quarter for crypto: Raoul Pal,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-dollar-falling-signals-positive-crypto-market-q2-2025-crypto-analyst,2025-03-06,"Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal says the weakening United States dollar could lead to a crypto market boost in the second quarter of the year, with Bitcoin jumping nearly 4% over the past 24 hours as the greenback continues to slide.
“With the dollar, rates and oil headed lower (all specific aims of Bessent), financial conditions are now easing fast and lead risk assets by a couple of months,” Pal said in a March 5 X post.
It comes only a day after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed his vision to reduce US interest rates.
Q2 could be bullish for crypto
“Should signal a good Q2 for tech and crypto and hopefully H2 2025 too as these trends continue,” he said. Since 2013, the second quarter has been Bitcoin’s third-best quarter on average, with returns of 26.89%, according to CoinGlass.

Pal said that out of all three factors, the US dollar is the most critical factor in the crypto market. When the dollar weakens, investors often seek alternatives, such as crypto assets, to protect their wealth. 
Since Feb. 5, the US Dollar Index (DXY) — which tracks its strength against a basket of major currencies — has dropped 2.79% to 104.258, according to TradingView data.

Analysts repeated the warning again when Donald Trump was elected as US President in November, as the US dollar rose to yearly highs. 
At the time, Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts said, “The macro backdrop has soured. Dollar strength is not good for Bitcoin.”

Is Ether price at a generational entry or lost cause?
The second largest cryptocurrency is drawing mixed opinions from the crypto industry. Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade was deployed on the Sepolia testnet on March 5, and Gabriel Halm, a research analyst at IntoTheBlock, believed it could potentially ease ETH’s recent selling pressure. Earlier this week, Halm said,
“While Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade won’t necessarily trigger an instant price bump, it marks a significant step forward in the ongoing improvements to the Ethereum ecosystem.”
Likewise, Louie, a crypto analyst, drew a similarity between Ethereum’s current bearish predicament and Bitcoin in 2023. The analyst implied that both assets display similar price structures, market sentiment and catalysts, which may eventually allow ETH to “rhyme” BTC’s bullish breakout from 2023.

On the contrary, Matthew Hyland, a market analyst, said that Ethereum is possibly already in a bear market. With Ethereum objectively in a 357-day downtrend, Hyland believed no correlation existed between BTC and ETH in the current market. The analyst said,
“Up until a year ago everything was in a bull together and a bear together, now its mixed.”
Additionally, the analyst mentioned that ETH’s price bottom will potentially outline the beginning of the next cycle.
Meanwhile, the confirmed double top pattern on the weekly and monthly charts increases the probability of a deeper correction for the altcoin.
Nebraskangooner, a crypto commentator, told his 379,900 followers that based on the pattern, the measured breakdown target is around $1,200, another 42% below ETH’s current price.

Only 26% of Ethereum addresses are profitable
Between Dec. 1, 2024, and March 4, 2025, Ethereum price declined 50% in just 78 days. While such drastic corrections are common with low-cap crypto assets, ETH has lost more than $250 billion in market cap during that period.
This sharp, bearish turnaround has undoubtedly affected investors as well, with data from IntoTheBlock suggesting that only 26% of all addresses holding 36.92 million ETH are in profit. A staggering 70% of addresses are “out of the money,” with only 4.46% of addresses at breakeven value.

From a technical perspective as well, Ethereum’s weekly close has taken place under a 980-day uptrend, dating back to previous cycle lows in June 2022. A break below the ascending trendline indicates a long-term trend reversal, which might be a warning sign for the bulls.
However, the altcoin recovered sharply over the past 24 hours, jumping 12% from recent lows at $1,996 to upward of $2,242.

The relative strength index (RSI) has also dropped to multi-year lows, which further confirms the bearish nature of Ethereum’s long-term market structure. Yet, it could potentially imply weakness in selling pressure as well in the short-term, leading to relief rallies.

volatility is approaching cycle highs as jitters around a looming trade war and a planned US cryptocurrency stockpile reach a crescendo, according to data from TradingView and Glassnode. 
The conflicting bullish and bearish signals, which peaked after US President Donald Trump took office in January, have sent crypto prices on a dizzying ride, the data shows.
“As demonstrated by the intense whipsaw in price action, this has led to very turbulent conditions over the last two weeks against a backdrop of an uncertain political environment,” Glassnode said in a March research note.

Bitcoin’s realized volatility — one measure of daily price variations — has “recorded some of the highest volatility values of the cycle so far, exceeding 80%” on one- and two-week timeframes, according to Glassnode.

Meanwhile, the digital currency’s average true range (ATR), another volatility measure, has reached cycle highs of more than 4,900, up from around 3,000 in late February, according to data from TradingView.

The sell-off signaled that macro factors could overpower bullish industry developments, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s dismissal of several lawsuits against crypto firms in February. 
On March 4, cryptocurrency derivatives traders suffered more than $1 billion in liquidations as spot prices whipsawed.

price surged 14.2% after rebounding from the $2,000 support level on March 4 but has struggled to sustain levels of $2,200. Notably, ETH has underperformed the broader cryptocurrency market by 11% over the past two weeks, reflecting investor uncertainty. To regain bullish momentum, key obstacles must be addressed.

While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons behind traders reducing ETH exposure, several factors likely contributed to weaker sentiment. These include declining onchain activity, a lower total value locked (TVL), a net positive ETH issuance rate, and speculation surrounding a potential US strategic digital asset reserve. Overall, demand for ETH as Ethereum’s native token appears weaker.

and ETH hold this status, yet Ether ETFs saw $336 million in net outflows between Feb. 19 and March 4. While this highlights weak ETH performance, it appears more as a symptom than a primary cause.

The Ethereum network maintained its leadership in 7-day decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, reaching $22.45 billion. However, the gap with competitors narrowed, particularly as Solana saw a 4% gain over the same period. Key weaknesses for Ethereum included a 49% drop in activity on Curve Finance and a 16% decline in Pendle volumes, according to DefiLlama data.
Similarly, Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) fell 13% over two weeks to $50.8 billion, raising concerns about whether ETH can outperform the broader cryptocurrency market in the near term. In comparison, BNB Chain’s TVL declined by 8% in the same period, though it remains significantly smaller at $5.1 billion.

Uniswap was among the weakest performers in Ethereum deposits, with total value locked (TVL) dropping 22.5% over 30 days. Other notable declines included Ether.fi (-18.8%), Lido (-17.3%), and Morpho (-17%).
The slowdown in Ethereum’s onchain activity has created an unusual scenario where average transaction fees fell below $1 for the first time since July 2020. However, demand for blockchain processing remains weak, leading to an increase in ETH supply. The burn mechanism introduced by EIP-1559 has been largely offset by the expansion of blob space for layer-2 scalability solutions.

Whether the upcoming Pectra network upgrade can balance fee distribution across the Ethereum ecosystem is still unclear. However, it’s likely that more adjustments will be needed later. Additionally, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has reportedly confirmed that Bitcoin would receive a “unique status” under Donald Trump’s plans.
On March 7, the first White House crypto summit will bring together top industry executives, founders, and investors with representatives from the president’s working group on digital assets. They will discuss regulatory plans and Trump’s proposed crypto strategic reserves. Traders now worry that Ether has a low chance of being included as a leading asset, which could limit ETH’s upside potential.

With a $124 billion market cap discrepancy, one analyst identified a parabolic scenario for XRP, which according to data, has historical credibility. 
XRP/ETH eyes pivotal resistance breakout
Dom, an XRP market analyst, recently compared different timelines for the XRP/ETH chart that displayed XRP’s attempt to break a long-term resistance against its counterpart.

As shown above, the XRP/ETH pair is at a critical junction under the 0.0012 overhead resistance level, which has historically triggered a parabolic rally of 160% when breached. This multi-week outperformance for XRP possibly positions the altcoin for another breakout in 2025.

Dom said that if XRP can break through its current resistance level, it might rally on its own against ETH. Even if it only achieves half its typical past gains (about 80%), it could still surpass ETH in market cap.
Meanwhile, Bobby A, a crypto trader, believed that despite being in a “highly fearful market environment,” XRP has gained price acceptance above its previous cycle high from April 2021.

Irrespective of market volatility for the rest of 2025, the analyst predicted that XRP price could average around $2.29 to $2.61 in mid-2025, supported by market trends and the asset’s breakout from a long-term accumulation pattern.

XRP futures traders remain sidelined
XRP price jumped 15% over the past day in anticipation of the upcoming crypto summit in the White House, with the markets speculating positive news catalysts.
Alongside its price rise, onchain activity also exhibited a significant spike, with daily active addresses increasing by 135,000 on March 4. Over the past week, active addresses surged by 620%, rising from 74,589 to 462,650 since Feb. 28.

However, data from CoinGlass suggested that XRP futures traders were still inactive in the markets. After future open interest (OI) dropped by 63% between Jan. 18 and March 1 ($7.87 billion to $2.92 billion), the OI has registered a minor tick of 15% over the past few days, suggesting a lack of interest in the futures and perpetual market.

Elliott Wave analysis projects XRP price to $5.85
Dark Defender, a crypto market analyst, highlighted that XRP was trading above a key support zone in the four-hour timeframe, as shown in the chart below.
Note that this level represents the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the November rally to seven-year highs of $3.40. Dark Defender believes this marked the “Wave 2 bottom”  and “we are waiting for XRP to move toward $2.60.”
According to the analyst, the key levels to watch on the downside are $2.33 and $2.22, which must be maintained. If this happens, XRP price will continue its wave structure with the expected fifth wave targeting $5.85. Such a move would represent 132% gains from the current price.

According to the analyst, XRP followed a similar classic Fibonacci extension move in 2017, breaching the 161.8% extension level before making a parabolic move toward the 223.6% Fibonacci extension level.
If history repeats itself, “this would put XRP between $27 - $222, aligning with the Fibonacci extension tool and 2017 cycle correlations.”
The analyst, however, sets the medium target for XRP price between $8 and $13.
“XRP’s next major leg up could target $8.5 - $13 (Fib 1.272 and Fib 1.414).”

Increasing onchain activity backs XRP’s upside
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the XRP price drawdown over the last week pushed the cryptocurrency to a three-month low of $1.94 on Feb. 28. 
XRP investors took advantage of the lower levels and accumulated more at discounted prices. Onchain data from market intelligence firm Glassnode reveals that active XRP addresses have surged by a whopping 680% in the past week, jumping from 59,900 on Feb. 27 to 468,171 on March. 4.

Similarly, XRP transaction count increased by 23% over the same period, signaling growing network usage. 
Such a spike in network activity often indicates growing investor interest and could be an early signal of a potential bullish reversal. 
Popular analyst Brett also points out that whale activity rose in tandem with increasing onchain activity as large investors scooped approximately 1 billion XRP tokens in the past 24 hours.

BTC
$82,448
turned up from $81,500 on March 4, and the bulls are trying to extend the recovery above $90,000 on March 5. However, some analysts do not expect Bitcoin to run up in the near term. Bitfinex analysts said in a March 3 markets report that Bitcoin could face “significant resistance” at $94,000.
In another note of caution, CryptoQuant contributor XBTManager said in a Quicktake post that Bitcoin is likely to extend its consolidation for some time. Hence, risky trades should be avoided over the next few months. The analyst said the time to buy will come when short-term holders — those holding for under 155 days — start selling and the long-term holders start buying.

While the near-term price action remains uncertain, investors are confident about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas said in a Bloomberg interview that 70% of his investment portfolio is in Bitcoin-related assets, while the remaining 30% is made up of gold and gold miners. 
What are the critical support and resistance levels in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.
Bitcoin price analysis
Bitcoin looks to be forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the buyers and sellers.
BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The BTC/USDT pair reached the 20-day exponential moving average ($91,174), which is an important resistance to watch out for. A break above the 20-day EMA suggests the selling pressure is reducing. The pair will then try to rise above the resistance line of the triangle and charge toward the 50-day simple moving average ($97,259). A break and close above the 50-day SMA signals that the bulls are back in the game.
This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks below the triangle. That could result in a retest of the Feb. 28 intraday low of $78,258.
Ether price analysis

ETH

nosedived below $2,000 on March 4, but the bulls aggressively purchased at lower levels, as seen from the long tail on the candlestick.

Buyers have an uphill task ahead of them as the relief rally is likely to face solid resistance at the 20-day EMA ($2,467) and next at the downtrend line. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will again try to sink and sustain the ETH/USDT pair below $2,111. If they manage to do that, the pair could fall to $1,750.
The first sign of strength will be a close above the downtrend line. That suggests the bears are losing their grip. The pair may then rally toward $3,400.
XRP price analysis
XRP

Both moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If the price holds above the 20-day EMA ($2.47), the bulls will try to push the XRP/USDT pair to the resistance line. A break and close above the channel opens the doors for a rally to $3.40.

Conversely, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below $2.53, it will suggest that the bears have the upper hand. The selling could pick up on a break and close below $1.99. The pair may then plummet to $1.27.
BNB price analysis
BNB
BNB
$577.69
broke below the $557 support on March 4, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels.
BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The bulls are trying to start a recovery, which is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($619). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. That increases the risk of a break below $546. If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair could plunge to $500.
This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues higher and breaks above the 50-day SMA ($646). The pair could then rise to $686.
Solana price analysis
Buyers are aggressively defending the $125 support in Solana
SOL
$125.33
, as seen from the long tail on the March 4 candlestick.
SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
There is minor resistance at $151, but if that is crossed, the SOL/USDT pair could reach the 20-day EMA ($161). Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between the 20-day EMA and $180. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the pair may oscillate between $180 and $125 for a while.
Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $125, it will signal that every minor rally is being sold into. The pair could tumble to $110 and then to $100.
Cardano price analysis
Cardano
ADA
$0.7138
has been witnessing violent moves in the past few days, signaling a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.
ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The ADA/USDT pair bounced off the 20-day EMA ($0.80) on March 4, indicating that lower levels are attracting buyers. If the price stays above $1, the bulls will again try to push the pair to $1.25.
Usually, periods of high volatility are followed by a range compression. If the price fails to hold above $1, it will indicate selling on rallies. That may keep the pair range-bound between the 20-day EMA and $1 for some time.
Dogecoin price analysis
Dogecoin
DOGE
$0.1697
turned back from the 20-day EMA ($0.23) on March 3 and broke below the support line.

A minor positive for the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to skid below the $0.18 support. Buyers will again try to push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. If they can pull it off, it will suggest that the break below the channel may have been a bear trap. The DOGE/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($0.28).
On the downside, a break and close below $0.18 could start the next leg of the downtrend to $0.14 and eventually to the solid support at $0.10.

Pi price analysis
Pi (PI) witnessed a massive rally from $0.10 on Feb. 20 to $3 on Feb. 26, signaling aggressive buying by the bulls.
PI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
Profit booking pulled the price lower on Feb. 27, and the PI/USDT pair is taking support at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $1.55. The pair will attempt a relief rally to $2.38 and then to $2.80. A break and close above $3 will indicate the resumption of the uptrend toward $4.45.
However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to sell the rallies and pull the price below the $1.55 support. If they manage to do that, the pair could drop to the 61.8% retracement level of $1.20. 
Hedera price analysis
Hedera
HBAR
$0.1905
has been trading between the moving averages for the past three days, indicating uncertainty about the next directional move. 
HBAR/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The 20-day EMA ($0.23) has started to turn up gradually, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, suggesting a slight edge for the bulls. A break and close above the 50-day SMA ($0.26) could start a rally to $0.32 and later to $0.35.
Alternatively, a break and close below $0.22 suggests the bears are back in command. The HBAR/USDT pair may drop to $0.17, which is an important level for the buyers to defend.
Chainlink price analysis
Chainlink
LINK
$13.94
slipped below the support line of the descending channel pattern on March 4, but the bulls purchased the dip as seen from the long tail on the candlestick.
LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
Buyers will have to push and maintain the price above the 20-day EMA ($16.67) to suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. The LINK/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($20.12), which is likely to act as a strong resistance.
Contrarily, if the price turns down from the current level and closes below the support line, it will indicate that bears remain in control. The selling could accelerate below $13.08, pulling the pair toward $10.

Senator: US Bitcoin reserve lacks support
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed whipsaw BTC price action continuing as part of broader risk-asset volatility.
Geopolitical events maintained a firm grip on market performance, with stocks and crypto sensitive to developments over US trade tariffs and the reserve.
The latter appeared to get the green light earlier on the day as US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick implied that a separate Bitcoin-only stockpile would be announced at the White House Crypto Summit on March 7.

Thereafter, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, author of the Bitcoin reserve bill from 2024, acknowledged that there was a lack of Congressional support for the idea.
Proponents “might need to put a pin for a little while in the bitcoin strategic reserve because we're not there yet,” paraphrasing Tim Scott, chairman of the House Banking Committee, quoted by mainstream media.
Lummis was speaking at the Bitcoin Investor Day event in New York.
Crypto market commentators nonetheless sought to preserve optimism on the concept, suggesting that it was a matter of “not ‘if,’ but ‘when.’”
“We are going to get a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. There are too many smart people around the table for the United States to fumble this,” Professional Capital Management founder and CEO Anthony Pompliano, known as “Pomp,” argued in a post on X.
As Cointelegraph reported, various key industry figures have argued for a Bitcoin-only reserve to be the priority for the US government under President Donald Trump.
Bitcoin bulls “on borrowed time”
Summarizing the current trading environment, popular trader Jelle hoped for a resumption of upward momentum after an initial sell-off at the start of the US trading session.

“Yesterday - markets started pushing about 2 hours post-open. Let's see,” he wrote in part of an X thread.

Zooming out, others were conflicted. Despite holding some of its gains, BTC/USD was likely in for a rematch with 15-week lows of $78,000, fellow trader Justin Bennett warned.
“I still think we see a sweep of the $78,260 low, especially after the rejection from $92k monthly resistance,” he told X followers on the day.

3 reasons why Bitcoin sells off on Trump tariff news,https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-bitcoin-sells-off-trump-tariffs,2025-03-05,"Bitcoin

has declined by more than 15% since Feb. 3—when US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada—and was trading for as low as around $86,400 as of March 5.

Simultaneously, investors have withdrawn over $3.50 billion in assets from US-based Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) since Feb. 3, according to Farside Investors data.
Let’s examine why news of Trump’s tariffs is leading to selloffs in the Bitcoin market.
Economic uncertainty sours risk-on appetite
The US imposed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% on China on March 4, raising concerns over supply chain disruptions and rising prices, fueling fears of a “Trumpcession.”
Risk assets typically sell off in such scenarios—in August 2019, Trump’s trade war with China triggered an 800-point Dow Jones drop, but Bitcoin surged as Chinese traders used it to bypass capital controls.

The Chinese government took notice of these trends and increased crackdowns on Bitcoin trading and OTC platforms in late 2019 and 2020.
This time, however, Bitcoin is behaving like a risk asset, with its 30-week correlation with the Nasdaq hitting 0.91.

Additionally, JPMorgan has turned “tactically bearish” toward US equities during the trade war, which may hurt Bitcoin if the correlation sustains.
Bitcoin trades 24/7
Unlike traditional markets that close on weekends, BTC trades 24/7 and reacts instantly to macroeconomic developments.
When Trump’s tariff plans were confirmed over a weekend in early February, crypto traders moved quickly, selling off Bitcoin and other assets before stock markets could react.
This led to a sharp drop on Feb. 3, pushing Bitcoin to a three-week low of $91,000, while the broader crypto market shed over $1 trillion in value from its December peak by late February.
Conversely, Trump’s announcement of a US crypto strategic reserve on March 3—also a Sunday—sparked a 9.58% surge in Bitcoin, marking its strongest daily gain since Nov. 11, 2024.

That further highlights how policy shifts can drive extreme volatility in crypto markets, particularly during weekends when traditional markets are closed and fewer people are trading.
Global investors are hedging elsewhere
Typically, tariffs should strengthen the US Dollar Index (DXY) by reducing imports and boosting domestic demand.
However, this time, DXY peaked around Trump’s tariff announcement and has declined since, like Bitcoin, contradicting the usual bullish assumptions.

While Bitcoin and the dollar are both weakening, the euro has strengthened since Feb. 3. This suggests that global investors looking to hedge against the economic impact of tariffs are turning to fiat alternatives like the euro rather than Bitcoin.

Gold, like the euro, has also surged following Trump’s Feb. 3 announcement.

The Japanese Yen (JPY), another perceived safe haven, has climbed 4.5% since Trump’s Feb. 3 announcement.

Furthermore, if the tariff announcement triggers widespread fear of a trade war or economic slowdown, investors might pull out of risk assets and also avoid the dollar if they expect US economic growth to take a hit.
Therefore, Bitcoin tends to immediately sell off on certain news, such as new tariffs, because economic uncertainty prompts a flight from risk assets, exacerbated by crypto’s round-the-clock trading.
While some argue this could benefit Bitcoin long-term if inflation spikes, the knee-jerk market response is currently one of panic and retreat.

Solana sees $485M outflows in February as crypto capital flees to ‘safety’,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-sees-485-m-outflows-feb-amid-flight-safety-in-crypto-markets,2025-03-05,"Solana saw nearly half a billion dollars in outflows last month as investors shifted to what were perceived to be safer digital assets, reflecting growing uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market.
Solana
SOL
$125.37
was hit by over $485 million worth of outflows over the past 30 days, with investor capital mainly flowing to Ethereum, Arbitrum and the BNB Chain.
The capital exodus came amid a wider flight to “safety” among crypto market participants, according to a Binance Research report shared with Cointelegraph.

“Overall, there is a broader flight towards safety in crypto markets, with Bitcoin dominance increasing 1% in the past month to 59.6%,” the report stated.

”Some of the capital flowed into BNB Chain memecoins, driven in part by CZ’s tweets about his dog, Brocolli,” it added.
Beyond Solana, total cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped by 20% in February, driven by growing negative sentiment, Binance Research noted.
Alongside macroeconomic concerns, the crypto investor sentiment drop was mainly due to the $1.4 billion Bybit hack on Feb. 21, the largest exploit in crypto history. 
Disappointment in Solana-based memecoin launches has also curbed investor appetite, particularly after the launch of the Libra token, which was endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei.
The project’s insiders allegedly siphoned over $107 million worth of liquidity in a rug pull, triggering a 94% price collapse within hours and wiping out $4 billion in investor capital.

“Memecoins have evolved from community-driven social experiments into a chaotic landscape dominated by value extraction from retail investors,” Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum, told Cointelegraph, adding:
“Insider rings, pump-and-dump schemes, and sniper groups have replaced the organic, collectible nature of original memecoins, creating an unhealthy playing field.”

Binance Research attributed this capital rotation to the recent market turbulence:
“Influenced by macroeconomic factors such as escalating trade tensions and diminished expectations of interest rate cuts, the crypto market has had a rough February. In such an environment, investors may choose to take chips off the table and hold stablecoins as an alternative.”

Bitcoin price metric that called 2020 bull run says $69K new bottom,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-metric-called-2020-bull-run-69k-new-bottom,2025-03-05,"Bitcoin has a 95% chance of staying above $69,000 forever, a classic BTC price forecasting tool says.
In a post to X on March 4, network economist Timothy Peterson revealed a new floor level from the “Lowest Price Forward” metric.
Peterson: $69,000 BTC price has 95% chance of holding

BTC

remains highly sensitive to geopolitical decisions in 2025, last week hitting its lowest levels since November last year. 
Despite misgivings over the future of the crypto bull run among some market participants, Peterson remains optimistic both on shorter and longer timeframes.
Now, the Lowest Price Forward, which he created in 2019, gives $69,000 as a threshold that BTC/USD is extremely unlikely to cross again.
“Lowest Price Forward doesn’t tell you where Bitcoin will be. It tells you where Bitcoin won’t be,” he told X followers. 
“There is a 95% chance it won't fall below $69k.”

Lowest Price Forward has an impressive, albeit short, history. In June 2020, Peterson predicted that Bitcoin would never revisit four-digit prices from August of that year onward — which ultimately proved correct, subject to a delay of barely two weeks.
In January this year, Peterson delivered a $1.5 million BTC price target for the next 10 years. At the time, BTC/USD traded at around $92,000.
“The year is 2035. Bitcoin is at - and you can hold me to this - $1.5 million. And somewhere someone is asking ‘Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin?’” he wrote.
Bitcoin “cooling off period” may last 3 months
Continuing, Peterson suggested that the recent trip to $78,000 was itself unsustainable.

In late February, he argued that it would be “difficult” to force the market below $80,000, based on the Bitcoin Price to Trend metric.
Further X analysis acknowledged that a rapid return to BTC price upside may take some time.
“Capitulation events like today are always followed by a 2-3 month cooling off period,” reads a post from Feb. 25, when a long liquidation cascade was already in progress.  
“After that it's game on again like nothing ever happened.”

Why is Cardano (ADA) price up today?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-cardano-ada-price-up-today,2025-03-05,"Cardano

Let’s take a closer look at all the main factors driving ADA price up today.
Anticipation for the White House Crypto Summit
The first-ever White House Crypto Summit, scheduled for March 7, 2025, is generating significant buzz across the crypto industry, and Cardano is no exception. 
What to know:
US President Donald Trump will host the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7.
The summit is aimed at bringing together industry leaders to discuss regulatory policies, stablecoin oversight, and the potential role of cryptocurrencies in the US financial system.
The attendees will include prominent industry leaders, including potentially Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, along with members of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. 
The summit will be chaired by Sacks and administered by Bo Hines, the executive director of the Working Group.

— David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 1, 2025
This comes after Trump’s recent announcement of a US Strategic Crypto Reserve, explicitly naming Cardano alongside Bitcoin
BTC
$82,451
, Ether
ETH

, XRP
XRP

, and Solana
SOL
$125.39
This has fueled speculation about a pro-crypto regulatory shift, with the summit expected to clarify the administration’s stance on digital assets. 
The inclusion of ADA in the proposed reserve signals is boosting investor confidence. 
Markets often rally in anticipation of favorable policy, and today’s price uptick reflects traders positioning themselves ahead of potential announcements that could cement Cardano’s role in a national blockchain strategy. 
While details remain sparse, the summit’s promise of regulatory clarity is a powerful catalyst for ADA’s current momentum.

Cardano TVL recovers by 52%
DeFi protocols on the Cardano Network have also significantly increased since Feb. 28, improving investor trust. 
Cardano’s total locked value (TVL) rose from $268 million to $408 million in six days, marking 52% weekly gains.

The rise in TVL was led by Indigo (synthetics protocol), Liqwidi (Lending), and MinSwap (DEX), which registered increases of 32%, 30% and 29% in locked value, respectively, over the past seven days.

Cardano has also witnessed a considerable increase in onchain activity, evidenced by an increase in daily transactions since March 1, as per data from Artemis.

Cardano’s open interest (OI) has also increased by $325 million over the same period, reaching $874.4 million on March 5.
The funding rate remained negative, suggesting that many traders were shorting ADA, anticipating a pullback.
If bullish momentum continues, this could trigger a short squeeze, forcing bears to cover positions and pushing ADA even higher.

ADA price still validates a bull flag
ADA confirmed a bull flag pattern on March 2, when it breached the upper boundary of the flag in the weekly timeframe at $0.80. 
What you should know:
ADA is currently testing the resistance level at the $1.20 psychological level, as shown in the chart below.
A high volume move above this level could accelerate the recent bullish momentum toward the technical target of the prevailing chart pattern at $3.20.
This would represent a 238% gain from the current level.
ADA/USD weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The relative strength index (RSI) is above the midline and has risen from 47 to 58 over the last 30 days, indicating an increasing bullish momentum. 
The RSI’s value of 58 suggests that there is more room for the upside before oversold conditions set in again.
Conversely, a weekly candlestick close below the upper boundary of the flag at $0.80 could invalidate the bullish thesis. 
If this happens, ADA may continue its consolidation within the flag for a few more days.
The ADA price is “showing strong recovery at $0.95, up 21.87%,” said crypto analyst Kwantxbt in a March 5 post on X, adding:
“Volume surge and tight consolidation suggest the potential for a run up into the $1.05-1.10 range. Support at $0.92.”

Bitcoin will ‘likely continue to consolidate’ in this pullback phase — Analyst,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-consolidation-likely-pullback-phase-crypto-analysts,2025-03-05,"Bitcoin’s latest pullback amid broader macroeconomic uncertainty may not see it rebound to its January $109,000 all-time high (ATH) as quickly as some hope, an analyst says.
“We should assume that we are in the pullback phase after the ATH and will likely continue to consolidate for some time due to liquidity needs,” CryptoQuant contributor XBTManager said in a March 5 analyst note.

In the days leading up to Bitcoin reaching $109,000 for the first time on Jan. 20, before US President Donald Trump’s inauguration, short-term holders began increasing their supply, while long-term holders reduced theirs through selling, they explained.
Bitcoin’s $109,000 high on Jan. 20 led to a drop of around 100,000 BTC in long-term holder supply over the following 30 days, but an even larger decline followed in December when it first hit six figures.

On Dec. 1, long-term holder supply reached 15.2 million BTC, just four days before Bitcoin reached $100,000 on Dec. 5, according to Bitbo data. By Dec. 20, it declined to 14.7 million.

At the time of publication, long-term holder supply is 14.4 million BTC, a decline of 800,000 BTC since Dec. 1.
Bitcoin retraced below $100,000 on Feb. 4 amid fears of a trade war on Trump’s promised tariffs. It fell even lower to $85,000 at the Feb. 27 Wall Street open as markets digested confirmation of new US tariffs.

Later that day, the asset plummeted below the crucial $80,000 price level, erasing nearly all the gains made after Trump was elected president on Nov. 5.
At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $87,100, according to CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin will face ‘significant resistance’ reclaiming $94K: Analysts,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-significant-resistance-94k-level-crypto-analysts,2025-03-05,"Bitcoin may struggle to move above $94,000 after its failed attempt to reclaim the price level two days ago, Bitfinex analysts say.

fell below $94,000 on March 2 and has yet to bounce back.
Strong spot Bitcoin market sell-pressure nulls Trump gains
The Bitfinex analysts linked this prediction to the recent volatility following US President Donald Trump’s March 1 announcement pledging a crypto reserve, which saw Bitcoin quickly surge 12% from $85,000 to $95,000.
However, the analysts said that intense selling pressure in the Bitcoin spot market has already erased most of those gains. With Bitcoin currently trading at $87,190, a move back to $94,000 represents an almost 8% increase, as per CoinMarketCap data.

The consensus among crypto analysts for Bitcoin’s price in the short-term appears uncertain, with no apparent signs that the downtrend is over or strong signals of an emerging uptrend.
Pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital said in a March 4 X post that while “history suggests the bottom may very well be in on this downside deviation,” further downside remains a possibility.
Rekt said that while Bitcoin may see some form of price stability around the range low of $93,500 over the coming days, it does not mean that the price won’t “downside deviate” below $93,500 again.
Volatility to reign until genuine buyers enter market
Crypto analyst Axel Adler said in a March 4 X post it was a “good sign” that buyers “bought up” Bitcoin when it recently tapped $81,000.
Meanwhile, MN Trading founder Michaël van de Poppe said, “Honestly, I think we’ll need to wait until this week is over as there’s a lot of macro-economic data & events.”

Master Ventures founder Kyle Chasse recently said Bitcoin’s price will continue to experience volatility until genuine buyers start entering the market rather than traders seeking arbitrage opportunities.
The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment, shows a score of 20 in the “Extreme Fear” category, where it has been since Feb. 25.

Bitcoin price stabilizes near $83K as investors eye S&P 500 recovery,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-stabilizes-near-83k-as-investors-eye-s-p-500-recovery,2025-03-05,"Bitcoin's

recent volatility highlights how markets tend to overreact, especially in situations that can escalate, such as trade wars. The 6.5% drop in the S&P 500 since its all-time high on Feb. 19 might seem minor in absolute terms, but the potential earnings impact is more significant. However, derivatives markets suggest Bitcoin’s dip below $83,000 should be short-lived.
Traders tend to sell off assets when they sense a recession coming. Presently, investors are moving into cash and short-term government bonds. This shift explains why the US 2-year Treasury yield recently hit its lowest level in five months. Traders are willing to accept lower yields, which shows strong buying interest.

Bitcoin derivatives markets held firm despite the 16% correction since the rejection at $99,500 on Feb. 21, indicating that whales and market makers do not expect further declines. More importantly, even if the much-anticipated United States strategic digital asset reserves fail to secure congressional approval, there is still strong political momentum at the state level, keeping the initiatives alive.

Bitcoin futures have maintained a stable 6.5% annualized premium (basis rate) over spot markets as of March 4, unchanged from the prior week. This metric remains within the neutral 5% to 10% range observed over the past four weeks — a clear indication that professional traders are unfazed by recent volatility, showing confidence in market stability.

The Bitcoin options 25% delta skew (put-call) stood at 4% on March 4, reflecting balanced pricing between put (sell) and call (buy) options. Given the failed attempt to reclaim the $94,000 support on March 3, the low demand for protective puts signals resilience among investors.
Bitcoin’s dip below $83,000 reflects macroeconomic uncertainty
US Senator Cynthia Lummis predicted that state governments will likely adopt Bitcoin into strategic reserves before the federal government. Utah’s HB230 “Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments” bill has already passed the House and, if approved by the Senate, could allocate up to 5% of state reserves to Bitcoin through a qualified custodian or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
However, Bitcoin’s ability to regain bullish momentum remains closely tied to traditional market sentiment. Traders worry that 20% or greater two-week price drops in companies like Tesla, TSM, Broadcom, and ARM signal that the artificial intelligence sector has entered a bear market, potentially impacting sales of the world’s largest corporations and reducing investor appetite for risk assets.
Investors are worried that US economic growth will slow down, and this seems likely based on the Atlanta Fed’s real GDP estimate. If the US economy contracts by 2% or more in the first quarter, the valuations of publicly listed companies could drop sharply. At the same time, higher vacancies in commercial real estate could increase credit risks, putting serious pressure on the banking sector.
The recent drop in Bitcoin below $83,000 is not really tied to the success or failure of the US digital asset strategic reserve. Instead, investors are pulling out of riskier assets like artificial intelligence stocks and consumer cyclical companies. On March 3, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $74 million in outflows, adding to the uncertainty. Investors worry that institutional demand will remain weak, reflecting a tougher macroeconomic environment.
Chances are Bitcoin’s price will remain below $90,000 until the S&P 500 shows that a normal correction is over—when investors fear a recession, they cut back on risky assets. Still, Bitcoin derivatives data suggests the risk of a bigger drop is low for now.

Bitcoin edges closer to multimonth lows
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed new local lows of $82,037 for BTC/USD on Bitstamp.
A rebound then took the pair, still down over $10,000 versus the prior day’s high, to near $85,000.
Bitcoin and altcoins felt the heat thanks to US tariffs against Mexico and Canada going into effect, while plans for a US strategic crypto reserve remained elusive ahead of a dedicated White House Crypto Summit event on March 7.
“This sell-off was exacerbated by Trump’s renewed push for tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, reinforcing investor concerns over escalating trade tensions,” trading firm QCP Capital wrote in its latest analysis sent to Telegram channel subscribers.
QCP noted that stocks were also struggling in the face of tariff pressures, something likely on the radar for President Donald Trump.
“This downturn could intensify pressure on Trump, especially after the strong support and donations he received from the crypto community during his campaign,” it continued. 
“Even the SEC’s latest move — pausing and dismissing enforcement cases against crypto firms — failed to stem the sell-off, underscoring broader risk aversion in the market. After a month of subdued cross-asset volatility, market anxiety has resurfaced with the prospect of tit-for-tat tariffs dampening global growth sentiment.”

Trading firm Mosaic Asset meanwhile took an optimistic view of how risk-asset performance could evolve in the short term.
“Bearish investor sentiment and oversold breadth are conditions that can help see a rally unfold,” it argued in the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Market Mosaic,” on March 2.
“Near-term, seasonality and cycle trends for the S&P 500 can become a tailwind as well. The last two week’s of February are historically among the most negative for the S&P 500, but March is the best month during the first half of the calendar year for the past 15 years on average.”

As Cointelegraph reported, Julien Bittel, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor, last week forecast a March recovery thanks to shifting macroeconomic conditions.
“Everything happening in markets right now, especially in crypto, is a direct consequence of the tightening of financial conditions in Q4 last year,” he told X followers.
The US dollar index (DXY) meanwhile hit 12-week lows on the day before seeing a modest relief bounce of its own.

Is crypto’s ‘Trump effect’ short-lived?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trump-effect-short-lived,2025-03-05,"Many in the crypto community believed that US President Donald Trump’s second-term election would send Bitcoin prices skyrocketing, and it did — from $69,374 on Election Day (Nov. 5) to a record $108,786 when the new administration took office on Jan. 20.

The new administration stormed into office committed to establishing a strategic crypto reserve, crypto-friendly cabinet appointments, and market-structure reform legislation, among other changes. It has mostly delivered on its promises so far. 
Still, it’s not too early to ask: Has the “Trump effect,” the surge in Bitcoin’s price anticipated from the election of America’s first crypto-friendly president, been oversold?
Perhaps macro factors, like a looming tariff war and a weakening global economy, are to blame for the slumping market prices. Then there was the Bybit hack in late February, which drained $1.4 billion from the world’s second-largest crypto exchange by volume. Perhaps the Trump administration itself is even to blame for fostering chaos and insecurity in its first six weeks in office?
“Macro factors and crypto blowups combine to erode confidence,” noted Bloomberg on Feb. 25. Elsewhere, the Financial Times observed that while some investors were hoping Trump’s election would herald a golden era for crypto, others, such as prominent US hedge fund Elliott Management, were warning that Trump’s embrace of crypto could lead to an “inevitable collapse” that “could wreak havoc in ways we cannot yet anticipate.” 
A “healthy correction”?
“While the recent Bybit situation has been significant, Bitcoin’s price momentum shift started well before the record-setting $1.46 billion hack,” Garrick Hileman, an independent cryptocurrency analyst, told Cointelegraph. 
Indeed, the correction follows traditional market cycles — i.e., a “classic” case of “buy the rumor, sell the news,” said Hileman, further observing:
“The largest crypto gains occurred leading up to and just after Trump’s election victory, so a market cooldown was expected and may even be a healthy correction.”
Moreover, cryptocurrencies are more intertwined with traditional markets these days, making crypto prices sensitive to macroeconomic concerns like inflation, interest rates and trade tensions. “These broader economic pressures are dampening risk appetite across the board,” noted Hileman.

Justin d’Anethan, head of sales at token launch advisory firm Liquifi, agreed that the market has simply experienced a traditional “buy the rumor, sell the news” circumstance.

Enthusiasm about potential pro-crypto policies under a new US administration drove prices to record highs, but enthusiasm turned to pessimism with questions about policy implementation timelines. “With no immediate regulatory changes materializing, the market corrected,” d’Anethan told Cointelegraph.
Add the Bybit hack, for which the Federal Bureau of Investigation has blamed North Korea, and “you get a severely undermined investor confidence,” he continued. Moreover, the subsequent laundering/liquidation of the stolen assets across various platforms “has created very real downward pressure on the market,” even as Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) acquired a massive amount of Bitcoin, d’Anethan added.
Trends remain positive
Still, “The long-term outlook remains positive,” James McKay, founder and principal of McKayResearch, a digital assets consultancy, told Cointelegraph. “We’ve never had a bull cycle that wasn’t interspersed with multiple 30%, 40% or even 50% corrections.”
“We’ve had more positive regulatory developments in the past year than over the previous four years combined,” McKay said, including the Securities and Exchange Commission’s repeal of SAB 121 on Jan. 23, “which will allow mainstream financial institutions to custody crypto.”
Nevertheless, some uncertainty about Trump’s policies may still be creeping in, even as optimism remains high, Hileman suggested:
“Questions remain about whether key initiatives — such as a formal ‘crypto council’ or a national Bitcoin reserve — will actually materialize.”
On March 2, for example, it was reported that the crypto reserve plan still required a congressional vote. 
“If Trump’s promises stall or fail to meet expectations, sentiment will dampen further,” Hileman opined.
“Effects are still unfolding”
Maybe the crypto sector was overly optimistic following the US November elections? 
Hileman doesn’t think so. “The positive impact of Trump’s election on crypto markets is real, but its effects are still unfolding,” he added.
Crypto-friendly cabinet and agency appointments like Paul Atkins at the SEC, Howard Lutnick at the Department of Commerce, and David Sacks as crypto czar are concrete, meaningful events. Elsewhere, Coinbase and Uniswap no longer have to fear setbacks from regulators, as regulatory investigations into those cryptocurrency exchange platforms have been dropped.

But the longer-term implications of a Trump administration remain unclear, according to Hileman. “Recent events, such as Argentina’s president unexpectedly endorsing a pump-and-dump memecoin, highlight the risks of political figures engaging with crypto.”
Meanwhile, the Trump family, with its own “personal” crypto initiatives, “risk making similar mistakes that could prompt a crypto backlash,” added Hileman.

How to restore market price growth
What, if anything, can the administration do in the coming months for Bitcoin and other coins to restore market price growth?
“Continued progress on regulatory guidance, particularly with respect to lowering barriers for TradFi participation, is probably the single most bullish development currently at play,” said McKay. He doesn’t think that the “axing” of SAB 121 has been fully appreciated by the market — another reason prices might rise soon. 
There are other long-term drivers that haven’t been discussed much in recent news cycles but are critical for future adoption and market price growth, including continued strong demand for crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), rising corporate and sovereign adoption, and “the creeping post-halving supply shock,” added McKay.
Then, too, temporarily lower prices for Bitcoin, Ether

and other cryptocurrencies aren’t necessarily a bad thing. They can represent a buying opportunity. “It would be shocking not to see massive players and even retail investors salivate at [the prospect of purchasing] crypto now essentially 20%-25% cheaper,” said trader d’Anethan.
Hileman expects the new administration to deliver on its promise to create a crypto reserve within the US government, which would surely provide a boost to the industry, even as the sector strays further away from crypto’s decentralized cypherpunk origins.

BTC
$82,451
price has declined by more than 8.5% over the last 24 hours days after rallying to $95,000 on Sunday, March 2.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the price of Bitcoin suddenly dropped from a high of $94,422 on March 3 to an intra-day low of $82,450 on March 4.

Bitcoin’s price drop coincides with a marketwide drawdown fueled by the implementation of trade tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump’s administration on imports from Mexico, Canada and China.

The ensuing sell-off has left market participants wondering how much deeper the drawdown can go.
Bitcoin wipes out liquidity in tumble to $82,000
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed losses mounting during the Asia and Europe trading session.
Key points:
BTC price fell as low as $82,450 on Bitstamp, wiping out all the gains made between March 1 and March 2.
This came as the US tariffs against China, Mexico and Canada took effect.
24-hour crypto market liquidations hit $980 million, per data from monitoring resource CoinGlass.
As Bitcoin fell below $90,000, it wiped out more than $350 million in long positions between March 3 and March 4.

Additional data from CoinGlass showed intensive bands of buyer interest within the $70,000 - $80,000 range.
This suggests that Bitcoin’s price might drop further to sweep the liquidity within this range before staging a sustained recovery.

Reacting, crypto analyst AlphaBTC noted that “Bitcoin fishing for liquidity” with its latest move, adding that strong selling could push the price to $70,000.
“I’m not seeing any strength at the moment, all of Crypto is  taking a beating.”

200-day SMA provides last line of defense for Bitcoin
From a technical point of view, Bitcoin’s price is sitting on immediate support above $82,500, or the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).
What to know:
A drop below the 200-day SMA will cause the price to drop from the current levels toward lower lows. 
The first key level to watch is the Feb. 28 low, around $78,200.
Another area of interest is the fair gap value between $73,600 and $76,550, created during the November 2024 rally fueled by Trump’s election victory.
A bearish cross appeared on the daily chart when the 50-day SMA just crossed below the 100-day SMA, as shown below.
This indicates a shift in market sentiment from bullish to bearish, signifying a possible continuation of the downtrend.

Founder of MN Capital Michael van de Poppe argued that after being rejected by the resistance at $95,000, Bitcoin is back to “chopping around” in the four-hour timeframe.
For van de Poppe, a drop below the Feb. 28 low of $78,200 will result in a large volume candle that drives Bitcoin’s price toward mid-70,000.
“Honestly, I think we’ll need to wait until this week is over as there's a lot of macro-economic data and events and the Summit.”

Bitcoin no longer ‘safe haven’ as $82K BTC price dive leaves gold on top,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-no-longer-safe-haven-82k-btc-price-dive-gold-top,2025-03-04,"Bitcoin
BTC
$82,451
faces ongoing bearish catalysts as traders run to safe havens such as gold, new analysis warned.
In a dedicated X thread on March 4, trading resource The Kobeissi Letter announced a “global move” away from risk assets.
Bitcoin “no longer viewed as safe haven play”
Bitcoin and altcoins suffered, following stocks downhill as the US confirmed the start of fresh trade tariffs against Canada and Mexico.
BTC/USD fell $10,000 over a 24-hour period, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows, erasing its entire relief rally amid buzz over a US strategic crypto reserve.
While details of the latter are set to be revealed at the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, Bitcoin bulls were unable to reclaim lost support levels.
For Kobeissi, the writing was on the wall.
“The real driver here is the GLOBAL move towards the risk-off trade,” it explained. 
“As trade war tensions rise and economic policy uncertainty broadens, ALL risky assets are falling. This was seen in stocks, crypto and oil prices which all fell sharply today. Safe havens are thriving.”

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index finished the March 3 trading session down 1.76% and 2.64%, respectively.
Gold, by contrast, continued to consolidate gains while circling in an area immediately below all-time highs.
Kobeissi concluded that Bitcoin is “now viewed as a risky asset” in the current macroeconomic environment.
“Take a look at the sharp divergence between Gold and Bitcoin in their YTD performance,” it reasoned. 
“While gold prices are up +10%, Bitcoin is down -10% since January 1st. Crypto is no longer viewed as a safe haven play.”

BTC price meets bull market support trend line
Bitcoin thus joined the US Dollar Index (DXY) in an unusual syncopated move downward, which took the former toward the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) — a classic bull market support line.

Further remarks noted that BTC/USD had closed the biggest gap in history on CME Group’s Bitcoin futures market.
Previously, another gap left over from November 2024 was closed as part of Bitcoin’s descent to current multimonth lows near $78,000.

However, the altcoin retraced 50% of its rally on March 3, and one analyst highlighted that XRP whales are potentially making a move behind the scenes.
XRP whales sell at record levels
With XRP currently 30% below its all-time high, CryptoQuant founder Ki-Young Ju implied that large XRP addresses are potentially cashing out. With the help of XRP’s volume bubble map he highlighted heightened activity between $2 and $3 over the past month.

While high-volume activity can also be synonymous with buyers, Young-Ju stated that the altcoin is currently in a distribution phase.
From a technical perspective, a “distribution phase” describes a stage in the market cycle where major investors gradually sell off their holdings to lock in profits, typically occurring near the height of an uptrend.

Likewise, Maartunn, a verified onchain analyst, confirmed that XRP is undergoing a distribution phase. With the help of whale flow analysis, the analyst identified that negative whale flows calculated with a 30-day moving average (30-DMA) reached an all-time low level. The analyst added,
“This metric shows the Whale Flow. They are offloading $XRP like never seen before”

Meanwhile, the XRP exchange reserves on Binance also registered a sharp increase from 2.72 billion to 2.90 billion tokens. A rise in exchange reserves indicates higher selling pressure, which aligns with the above development of XRP’s distribution phase.

Despite the recent rally, Dom, an XRP market analyst, stated that the altcoin failed to hold an all-time high value of the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of $2.70.
In order for the trend to sustain any future rally, it is important for the altcoin to hold a position above the $2.50 range.
However, Dami DeFi, a crypto investor believed that XRP’s high time frame (HTF) chart indicates higher high consolidation below key resistance and ascending trendline. The investor added,
“With Trump backing $XRP for the U.S. reserve, once it flips this level, It’s game on for price discovery.”
On the contrary, Matt C, a cybersecurity engineer and Bitcoin proponent, dismissed XRP’s bullish behavior and identified the formation of an inverse head and shoulder for the altcoin. With the relative strength index (RSI) forming lower highs in XRP’s 1-day chart, the Bitcoin enthusiast believed that the altcoin’s current surge is “exit liquidity” for the masses.

"Bitcoin price action mirrors 2019 ‘Xi pump,’ are new BTC lows incoming?",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-evades-weekly-close-below-90-k-can-it-avoid-a-repeat-of-xi-pump,2025-03-04,"Bitcoin’s weekly chart was on track to close below $90,000 for the first time since November 2024, but a late surge pushed prices higher following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a crypto strategic reserve.

BTC
$82,452
weekly close formed a doji candle, closing at $94,222. With prices retesting the $95,000 overhead resistance, one analyst remained cautious about a repeat of 2019’s “Xi pump.”
Will Trump-pump follow the Xi-pump path?
In 2019, during a prolonged bearish trading period that stretched from June to October, Bitcoin’s market sentiment was low. However, on Oct. 25, 2019, China’s President XI Jinping’s announcement supporting blockchain technology triggered a significant price rise.
However, in subsequent days, China imposed a series of crackdowns on crypto assets and activities like mining, leading to new lows within 30 days.
Cold Blooded Shiller, an anonymous crypto analyst, drew similarities between the ‘Xi-pump’ and the current Trump pump, suggesting that sentiment rallies can often fizzle out due to lack of strength, and the market quickly adjusts itself to the prior trend.

As illustrated in the chart, the similarities between both periods followed similar retests of prior support ranges. In the first case below $10,000 in 2019 and below $95,000 in 2025, and the asset formed new lows 30 days later. The analyst added that in 2019, traders quickly acknowledged the pump as a “short squeeze and managed to get some very good entries.”

Likewise, Magus, a crypto trader, mentioned that bulls needed to prove themselves this week and carry out re-acceptance of the value area high (VAH) at $103,000 and value area low (VAL) at $91,000.

The VAH and VAL define a range where the majority of trading volume occurred during a selected time period on a chart, in this case, since November 2024. However, Magus also remained cautious of the Xi pump, stating:
“This is a textbook swing setup for me normally but if you've been around long enough you remember the Xi pump My gut tells me this move was exaggerated because of sentiment.”

Bitcoin remains in distribution, not accumulation
Data from Glassnode suggested that despite BTC’s rally, the short-term holders’ (STH) cost basis dropped below 1 after initially moving above $92,700. Bitcoin’s current price is below $92,700, which implies that STHs remained in a “fragile position” with profitability current at breakeven.
Additionally, the data analytics platform also stated that Bitcoin’s accumulation trend score remained under 0.5 for 58 consecutive days, underling a long period of net distribution.

A distribution period is defined as a phase of profit-taking by investors, which is often in line with market corrections. Glassnode added:
“Accumulation and distribution phases have alternated within a 57-65 day window on average. With the latest read at 0.9, the Trend Score indicates large entities are still in a net distribution regime, with no confirmed transition to accumulation yet.”

. The news triggered huge buying, with Bitcoin rising from about $85,000 to $95,000 and Cardano galloping more than 72%. The remaining altcoins also saw a strong rally.
However, Nansen principal research analyst Aurelie Barthere said that establishing a US crypto reserve will take time as it needs a vote in Congress. Research analyst Nicolai Sondergaard from the same blockchain analytics firm told Cointelegraph that the tokens selected for the crypto reserve are likely to witness volatility.

Prior to Trump’s announcement, the sentiment in the cryptocurrency sector remained negative. CoinShares reported $2.9 billion in outflows from cryptocurrency exchange-traded products last week. That marked the third consecutive week of outflows after a 19-week inflow streak.
After the initial reaction of short covering and buying by traders, will the rally continue? Let’s look at the charts to determine their support and resistance levels.
Bitcoin price analysis
Bitcoin fell below the 20-week exponential moving average ($90,623) last week and dipped near the 50-week simple moving average ($75,534), but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels.
BTC/USDT weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The upsloping moving averages indicate an advantage to buyers, but the negative divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) suggests that the bullish momentum is weakening. If the price slips and maintains below the 20-week EMA, it will signal the start of a corrective phase that could reach the 50-week SMA.
Contrarily, if the price remains above the 20-week EMA, it will indicate that the sentiment remains positive, and traders continue to buy the dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the all-time high at $109,588. A break above $109,588 could start the next leg of the uptrend to $138,000.
BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The BTC/USDT pair rose above the 20-day EMA on March 2, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. The $90,000 to $85,000 zone is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls. If the price rebounds off the support zone, it will increase the likelihood of a rally above $100,000. 
This positive view will be invalidated if the price continues lower and breaks below the support zone. That will indicate the bears are in control. The pair may tumble to $78,258 and then to $73,777.
Ether price analysis
Ether has been range-bound between $2,111 and $4,094 for the past several weeks, indicating buying near the support and selling close to the resistance.

Both moving averages have started to turn down, and the RSI is in the negative territory, suggesting that bears have an edge. If the price continues lower and breaks below $2,111, it will signal the start of a deeper correction to $1,500.
On the contrary, a strong rebound of $2,111 suggests that the bulls are aggressively defending the level. Buyers will have to propel the ETH/USDT pair above the moving averages to signal a comeback. The pair may then ascend to $4,094, which is likely to act as a strong barrier.
ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The pair bounced off the $2,111 support and reached the 20-day EMA ($2,544) on March 2. The failure to pierce the 20-day EMA suggests that the bears are selling on rallies. Sellers will again try to sink the pair below $2,111. If they manage to do that, the pair risks falling to $1,500.
Buyers will have to kick the price above the downtrend line to signal a comeback. The pair may then attempt a rally to $3,400 and subsequently to $3,750.
XRP price analysis
XRP has been struggling to sustain above $3, signaling that the bears are fiercely defending the level.
XRP/USDT weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The upsloping 20-week EMA ($2.18) and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that buyers have the edge. The bulls will have to push and maintain the price above $3 to indicate the start of the next leg of the uptrend toward $4 and then $5.
This optimistic view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-week EMA. There is strong support at $2, but if the level breaks down, it will signal the start of a deeper correction to $1.50.
XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The bulls pushed the pair above the $2.84 resistance on March 2 but are struggling to hold on to the breakout. The pair has dropped to the 20-day EMA ($2.50), which is an important support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to push the pair to $3.40. A break above this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend to $5.
Conversely, a break and close below the 20-day EMA risks a fall to the solid support at $1.99. A close below $1.99 will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, starting a downtrend to $1.50 and then $1.28.

Solana rebounded off the $125 support, but the relief rally is facing selling near the 50-week SMA ($173).
SOL/USDT weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The 20-week EMA ($191) has started to turn down, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating advantage to sellers. There is minor support at $157, but if the level cracks, the SOL/USDT pair could retest the $125 support. A break and close below $125 could sink the pair to $80.
If bulls want to prevent the downside, they will have to quickly drive and maintain the price above the 20-week EMA. Doing that will open the doors for a rally to $220 and later to $260. A break and close above $260 could start a new uptrend.
SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The pair surged above the 20-day EMA ($167) on March 2, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. This suggests that the bears are active at higher levels. If the price maintains below the 20-day EMA, the pair could slide to $125.
On the upside, a break and close above $180 suggests that buyers are back in the game. The pair may climb to the 50-day SMA ($200) and later to $220. Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $240 and $260.
Cardano price analysis
Cardano is trying to form a cup-and-handle pattern on the weekly chart, which will complete on a break and close above $1.25.
ADA/USDT weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The 20-week EMA ($0.82) is sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, signaling advantage to buyers. If the price closes above $1.25, the ADA/USDT pair could rise to $1.60 and later to the pattern target of $2.26.
Contrarily, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-week EMA, it will suggest a range formation in the near term. The pair could swing between $1.25 and the 50-week SMA ($0.59) for some time.
ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The pair skyrocketed above the descending channel pattern on March 2, indicating that the correction might be over. However, the sellers have not given up, and they pulled the price back into the channel. If the price remains inside the channel, it will suggest that the markets rejected the breakout. The pair may drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.85), which is likely to attract buyers.
If the bulls want to retain the advantage, they will have to quickly push and sustain the price above the resistance line. The pair may then rally to $1.25.

futures has emerged as the fastest growing trade on Bitrue after President Donald Trump announced plans to add the altcoin to a US strategic cryptocurrency reserve, the crypto exchange said on March 3. 
As of March 3, Bitrue traders hold ADA futures worth more than $26 million in notional value, up from a daily average of roughly $15 million in late February, according to data from Bitrue. 
Of those open positions, nearly 92% are long, indicating a bet the price of ADA will rise, Bitrue said. 
“As a result of all this increased interest, ADA/USDT [has] become the fastest growing trading pair in Futures,” the exchange said in an email.

In a March 2 post on Truth Social, Trump said he told his administration’s digital assets working group to include XRP

and ADA in a US government crypto stockpile. 
He later added Bitcoin

to that list, stating they would be at the “heart of the reserve.” Trump has touted plans for a US strategic crypto reserve since mid-2024 but has never before committed to adding ADA to the stockpile. 
The announcement caused a temporary spike in the price of each of the cryptocurrencies Trump mentioned in his post but had the most significant impact on ADA, which gained more than 40% in the first 24 hours after Trump’s announcement.

Languishing layer-1
Created by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson in 2015, Cardano was initially thought of as a serious competitor to Ethereum. 
However, performance issues and production delays caused the blockchain to languish, along with the price of its native ADA token. 
The cryptocurrency’s fully diluted valuation is less than $40 billion, compared to more than $260 billion for Ether, according to data from CoinGecko.
The chain has a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $440 million, versus more than $50 billion for the Ethereum network, according to DefiLlama.

Bitcoin price dumps again — Will $90K turn into resistance or support?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-dumps-again-will-90k-turn-into-resistance-or-support,2025-03-04,"Bitcoin
BTC
$82,462
price plunged from $93,700 to $89,250 in under an hour on March 3, wiping out half of the previous day’s gains. The drop likely triggered panic among traders as S&P 500 index futures fell 1% following China’s announcement of retaliatory measures against the United States’ additional 10% import tariffs.
Despite the sell-off, Bitcoin’s chances of reclaiming the $90,000 support remain strong. On March 2, US President Donald Trump stated that Bitcoin and Ether
ETH
$1,900
would be key components of the country’s strategic digital asset reserves. Trump also hinted that further details would be disclosed during the first government crypto summit on March 7.

The primary driver behind Bitcoin’s price drop on March 3 was the excessive expectations fueled by Trump’s weekend posts. Investors quickly realized the bureaucratic hurdles involved, including a lengthy approval process and the need for congressional approval. Additionally, doubts remain over whether the plan would involve actual purchases of these cryptocurrencies.
Source: MetaLawMan
Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at blockchain analytics firm Nansen, correctly anticipated that Bitcoin’s rally to $94,500 over the weekend was unsustainable. The 21% surge from the $78,300 low on Feb. 28 appeared exaggerated to some market participants, particularly given the ongoing global tariff war and broader macroeconomic uncertainty.

China's tariff retaliation could harm US economy; crypto reserve funding remains uncertain
China vowed to retaliate against Trump’s 10% tariff by targeting US exports, including soybeans and critical minerals like rare earths. This move could drive up food and tech costs, disrupt supply chains, and reduce rural incomes, potentially shrinking US GDP by 0.3% to 1.3%, according to economists. Hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci warned that if tensions escalate further, investors should brace for economic pain.
James “MetaLawMan” Murphy, a lawyer specializing in crypto legal and business issues, noted on X that even in the unlikely event that Congress swiftly approves the strategic digital asset reserve, the key question remains its funding source. Most likely, the initial approval would involve pausing government crypto asset sales—an action with limited impact on prices.
Another source of concern for Bitcoin traders came from Michael Saylor’s March 2 announcement that Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) neither issued new shares nor increased its BTC holdings beyond 499,096 in the previous week. Despite no prior indication, some traders had expected the company to “buy the dip.”
Source: RunnerXBT
Crypto trader and analyst RunnerXBT expressed frustration over Strategy purchasing $2 billion worth of Bitcoin at an average price near $97,500 but remaining inactive as BTC dropped to the $80,000 range. His analysis also suggests that Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases above $95,000 could be a net negative for the market, as the previous instance led to only a short-lived rally.
Related: MSTR stock pops 15% following Bitcoin weekend rally
Despite worsening investor sentiment toward the global economy, Bitcoin is likely to reclaim the $90,000 support as Strategy is expected to continue accumulating BTC through its $42 billion debt and stock issuance plan. Michael Saylor has never shown an intention to time the market when adding to the company’s Bitcoin holdings, suggesting further purchases regardless of price levels.
As for the expectations surrounding the strategic crypto reserves, the timeline remains uncertain, but the long-term impact on Bitcoin’s price is likely positive. BTC was designed to thrive in environments where investors perceive excessive stock market valuations or potential real estate corrections. Given these conditions, the probability of Bitcoin surpassing $95,000 in the near future remains high.

Bitcoin braces for Trump “investment announcement”
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD dropping below $90,000, shedding up to 5% on the day.
Initial excitement over the prospect of a US strategic crypto reserve saw weekly highs before sell-side pressure kicked in as TradFi returned.
A suggestion from US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on CNN that President Donald Trump should decide on tariffs against Canada later on in the day contributed to a nervous open for stocks.
Bitcoin’s own reversal took its toll on longs, with cross-crypto liquidations passing $150 million in the four hours to the time of writing, per data from monitoring resource CoinGlass.

A positive note meanwhile came from anticipation over a reported “investment announcement” scheduled by Trump for 1:30 pm Eastern Time.
Commenting on the current climate, trading firm QCP Capital was among those calling for a balanced view going forward.
“Following last night's clutch announcement, it's likely that Trump will do whatever it takes to avoid presiding over a prolonged stock market drawdown, a topic he previously championed but struggled with in recent weeks,” it argued in its latest post to Telegram channel subscribers.

QCP noted raised VIX volatility index levels, reflecting what it called “broader market unease in risk assets overall.”
“Just when we think Trump has exhausted his cards, he may still have more surprises up his sleeve,” it concluded.
“Which key events could shape the market this week — and could they be the catalyst for that elusive all-time high?”
BTC price teases higher low
Bitcoin traders hoped for a higher low construction to play out on BTC/USD, fueling a potential rally toward lost support levels closer to $100,000.

The day prior, Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, flagged the 21-week simple moving average (SMA) as the key reclaim level.
A weekly close above it, which BTC/USD subsequently achieved, constituted an “extremely bullish” sign.
“That said, be prepared for strong resistance around $90k, and potentially for a fakeout above the 21-Week MA before reverting back to a support test,” he forecasted.

Multiple catalysts are helping Ether rebound from its recent lows, namely:
Trump’s latest update on US’s Crypto Strategic Reserve.
Increasing ETH supply among whales.
Improving technicals, including a strong support confluence.

Ethereum whales are waking up
Ether’s gains in the past 24 hours further appear after a consistent increase in the ETH supply held by whales.
Key takeaways:
Large ETH holders (1K-10K ETH) have been stepping up their accumulation of ETH since January, data from Glassnode shows.

ETH price bounces from multimonth support
Ether’s gains today appear after testing a multimonth accumulation zone (the red area) that has historically led to short-term price rebounds.
ETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView
Key points:
Ether bears have failed to drive prices below the $2,100-2,500 range since December 2023.
The range includes a key support level in the form of the 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA; the blue wave), currently at around $2,300.
As of March 3, Ether is rebounding after testing the 200-week EMA as support, eyeing an extended rebound toward the 50-week EMA at around $2,910.
A breakout above the 50-week EMA could send the price toward the upper boundary of its prevailing rectangle pattern at around $4,000.
Source: Peter Brandt
Failing to breach the 50-week EMA could lead to a pullback toward the accumulation zone (or the 200-week EMA), potentially forming a head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern.

The H&S pattern resolves when the price breaks below its neckline support and falls by as much as the pattern’s maximum height.
If the current recovery fails, this technical rule brings $1,360 as Ethereum’s primary downside target.

SOL
$125.36
price is up today, buoyed by a significant recovery in the broader cryptocurrency market. SOL’s rebound came as President Trump announced that Solana would be included in the Strategic Crypto Reserve.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows SOL’s price is trading at around $162, up more than 15% in the last 24 hours and 28% from its local low of around $125 on Feb. 28.

Several factors driving the SOL price up today, including:
SOL price rally mirrors the broader crypto market recovery following President Trump’s Strategic Crypto Reserve announcement.
Approximately $38 million short SOL positions liquidated over the last 24 hours. 
SOL’s classic technical pattern paints a bullish target above $260.

XRP and ADA posted significant gains, rising by 16% and 64% over the last 24 hours.
The total crypto market cap has increased by 7% over the last 24 hours to $3.03 trillion.
SOL price jumped after President Trump’s announcement on March 2 that SOL, alongside XRP and ADA, will be part of a US Strategic Crypto Reserve.
Key points:
This followed an initial executive order on Jan. 23 directing a working group to explore a national digital asset stockpile.
Trump’s pro-crypto stance, a stark contrast to the Biden administration’s regulatory crackdowns, has bolstered investor confidence in the crypto industry. 
While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to make the US the “Crypto Capital of the World.”
This suggests a policy shift that legitimizes and institutionalizes crypto assets, with Solana named as a strategic asset.

Massive short liquidations push SOL prices higher
Solana’s bullishness on March 3 is accompanied by massive liquidations in the derivatives market, according to data from CoinGlass. 
The crypto futures market witnessed the liquidation of over $931 million in leveraged positions over the last 24 hours, with $550.5 million being short liquidations.
Over $38.3 million short SOL positions have been liquidated against $34 million long liquidations over the same period.

When short positions are liquidated, bearish traders are forced to sell their positions.
This adds to the tailwinds, causing the price to rise even higher.
Related: XRP, ADA, SOL go parabolic after Trump US crypto reserve post: Will other altcoins follow?
Furthermore, the rally in SOL price accompanies a recovery in its funding rates.
 SOL’s 8-hour funding rates have increased from 0-0.0027% on March 2 to 0.0074% on March 3, as shown in the chart below.
SOL funding rates performance. Source: CoinGlass
A rise in funding rates indicates increased demand for long positions and increased interest among SOL traders.
Can SOL price stage a V-shaped recovery to $260?
SOL’s price is painting a potential V-shaped recovery pattern on the daily chart, hinting at more upside. 
Key points:
A V-shaped recovery is a bullish pattern formed when an asset experiences a sharp price increase after a steep decline. 
It is completed when the price moves up to the resistance at the top of the V formation, also known as the neckline.
SOL price action since Jan. 19 appears to be developing a similar chart formation as shown in the chart below. 
The price now trades below key supply-demand levels: $184, where the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) is, and between $200 and $206, which are also the 100-day SMA and 50-day SMA.
This suggests that bulls need to push SOL above these levels for a potential retest of resistance at $245.
Higher than that, the next logical move would be the neckline of the prevailing chart pattern at $265.
This would represent a 68% uptick from the current price.
SOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The relative strength index has increased from oversold conditions at 26 on Feb. 26 to 43 on March 3, suggesting that the bullish momentum is picking up.
After yesterday’s rally in SOL’s price, independent analyst Grim believes the next short-term target lies between $205 and $220.

Trump champions the reserve in advance of the first White House crypto summit, promising “more to come.”
A big week of US employment data will culminate in Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaking on crypto summit day.
Bitcoin market indicators are showing signs of recovery, including a solid rebound in onchain profitability.
Sentient remains fearful as traders digest the latest developments. Is it too soon to believe in a bull market comeback?
Bitcoin traders warn of fresh BTC price dip
BTC price action is at the center of attention, but already not for the same reasons as last week.
Amid the US crypto reserve reaction, multimonth lows have given way to a solid rebound, which at one point topped 20%.
On some markets, BTC/USD even delivered a $10,000 daily candle, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.

Reacting, traders are now keen to delineate important support areas in the event of a retest.
“$90K-$91K area, which has acted as the range low the past few months, is a key area to watch,” trader Daan Crypto Trades wrote in one of his latest posts on X. 
“We saw a violent breakdown and retake back into the range. Price is currently testing it and this would be a region where bulls would want to step in. Daily closes are most important here so keep an eye on those during this week.”

Daan Crypto Trades referred to a three-month trading range in which BTC/USD remained prior to a liquidation cascade, which saw it fill a “gap” in CME Group’s Bitcoin futures markets at $78,000.

For others, including fellow trader Mark Cullen, another gap — the largest in Bitcoin’s history as a result of the daily candle — now risks providing a short-term downside magnet.
“That 90K liquidity got run and some. Now Bitcoin is eyeing the 95k level above yesterdays highs, which i think will be a target for US open,” he told X followers alongside a chart of order book liquidity. 
“The question for me is if the 85k level is retested to clean up the CME gap and inefficiency from yesterdays pump? would be one hell of a shake out if they did that to us....”

Crypto Summit week gets “Trump pump” treatment
Two social media posts were all it took to reignite a market frenzy over a US strategic crypto reserve.
As Cointelegraph continues to report, Trump returned to the topic over the weekend, suddenly appearing to confirm that a strategic crypto reserve will go ahead.

Now, the focus is switching to the long-term implications of such a move.
“This means Bitcoin is now OUT of bear market territory and ~16% away from a new all-time high,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of an X thread on the topic.
Kobeissi noted that the upcoming dedicated US crypto summit should yield further news triggers, referencing Washington’s crypto czar, David Sacks.
“President Trump has announced a Crypto Strategic Reserve consisting of Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies,” he responded on X after Trump’s posts. 
“This is consistent with his week-one E.O. 14178. President Trump is keeping his promise to make the U.S. the ‘Crypto Capital of the World.’ More to come at the Summit.”
Source: David Sacks
The event is due to take place on March 7, hosted by Trump.
Kobeissi nonetheless queried how many more “good news” stories for crypto could emerge from the new US administration.
“The question becomes, what’s the next big catalyst for crypto?” it summarized what it suggested may be the “biggest sentiment shift in crypto’s history.”
“We have seen just about all of Trump's campaign promises priced-in here. What's the next step in crypto adoption and the growth narrative?”
Fed Chair Powell to speak with jobs in focus
The week’s remaining macroeconomic developments are focused on key US employment data to which crypto markets have proven sensitive in recent months.
March 6 sees initial jobless claims, while the day after, the US jobs report will precede a speech from Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve.
Potential volatility catalysts thus remain stacked toward the end of the week.
Inflation remains a talking point, however, with markets keen for Fed guidance on the back of a pleasing result from its “preferred” inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, last week.
“This week is all about the labor market and the Fed,” The Kobeissi Letter said in its weekly outlook thread on X.
Kobeissi noted that the next Fed interest rate decision is two weeks away and “comes amid major market volatility.”

The latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool shows little belief that rate cuts will continue this month, with the odds at just 7%.
Coinbase premium hints at US demand rebound
Crypto market demand has some way to go before definitively recovering, various data sources show.
The Coinbase premium index, which tracks the difference in spot price between Coinbase’s BTC/USD pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT equivalent, is currently rebounding toward positive territory.
A positive premium accompanied much of Bitcoin’s run to current all-time highs through Q4 last year, indicating increased buyer interest in the US.
In one of its latest “Quicktake” blog posts on Feb. 6, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant said that the index was “showing signs of recovery.”
“Although this doesn’t confirm strong institutional buying yet, it does indicate a clear easing in selling pressure,” contributor Onat Tütüncüler commented. 
“Additionally, the 50-hour moving average crossing above the 170-hour moving average suggests a possible shift toward short-term bullish momentum.”

Tütüncüler noted similar signs from the adjusted spent output profit ratio (aSOPR) indicator, which measures the extent to which coins moved onchain are done so in profit or loss.
CryptoQuant data shows aSOPR currently back above the breakeven point, reflecting a return to aggregate profit after hitting its lowest levels since August 2024 during mass panic selling. 
“With selling pressure slowing and potential bottoming signals emerging, key resistance levels to watch in the coming days are $90,000 and $92,500,” he concluded. 
“Keeping an eye on further recovery in aSOPR and the Coinbase Premium Index will be crucial for Bitcoin’s next move.”

Crypto sentiment still fearful
Despite the positive weekend news catalysts, crypto market sentiment appeared to need further confirmation of better times ahead.
Related: When will Bitcoin price bottom?
The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which uses a basket of factors to determine a marketwide mood score among traders, still sat firmly in “fear” territory.
At 33/100 as of March 3, the Index had nonetheless recovered significantly from local lows of just 10/100 seen last week.

At the time, Julien Bittel, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor, saw the potential for a significant bull run comeback.

Some, however, remained cautious — especially given that the excitement over the crypto reserve contained a significant political element.
In another Quicktake post at the weekend, CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Avails warned that Trump might turn the tide against bulls once more.
“His recent statements about a ‘crypto reserve’ could ignite a new rally. However, it’s also possible that he might later reverse the sentiment with comments like, ‘We’ve paid off all our debts, we no longer need crypto.’ That’s exactly his style,” he argued.
“The actors change, but the cycles remain the same — only the timing shifts. From now on, our eyes will be on the charts, and our ears on Trump’s critical statements.”

"XRP, ADA, SOL go parabolic after Trump US crypto reserve post: Will other altcoins follow?",https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-ada-sol-go-parabolic-after-trump-us-crypto-reserve-post-will-altcoins-follow,2025-03-03,"Bitcoin witnessed solid buying over the weekend as US President Donald Trump announced that Bitcoin, Ether , XRP , Solana and Cardano would be included in a crypto strategic reserve. The announcement massively pumped the chosen coins, which made it risky for a fresh entry after the rally. The coins in this article have been selected for their technical setups rather than the Trump-based pump.
Apart from the crypto strategic reserve, in a sign that could create new demand for Bitcoin, BlackRock added the iShares Bitcoin ETF Trust (IBIT) to its $150 billion model portfolio, according to a Bloomberg report. The global investment firm is adding 1% to 2% allocation to portfolios that allow for alternative assets. This move opens the doors for a potential new demand for the Bitcoin ETF.

However, some analysts believe that Bitcoin could witness some more pain in the near term. They anticipate Bitcoin to drop near $70,000 before starting the next leg of the bull move. Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin could “establish firm support in the $72,000 to $80,000 range.”
Could Bitcoin manage to hold above $90,000? If that happens, select altcoins apart from the ones chosen for the crypto strategic reserve may find buyers. Let’s look at the top cryptocurrencies that look strong on the charts.
Bitcoin price analysis
Bitcoin has reached the 20-day exponential moving average ($92,366), indicating aggressive buying at lower levels.
BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
Sellers will try to stall the relief rally at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to $85,000, which is a crucial support to watch out for. 
If the price rebounds off $85,000, the pair could rise above the 20-day EMA. The pair may then rally to the 50-day simple moving average ($97,704). Such a move will signal that the pair may have bottomed out in the near term.
If bears want to retain the advantage, they will have to swiftly pull the price below $83,000. If they manage to do that, the pair could retest the critical $78,258 support. 
BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The 20-EMA has started to turn up on the four-hour chart, and the relative strength index (RSI) has jumped into the overbought zone, indicating that the bulls are on a comeback. If the price remains above $90,000, the pair could climb to $96,000 and then $100,000.
The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 50-simple moving average. That could sink the pair to the 20-EMA, which is likely to attract buyers. The bears will be back in the driver’s seat if they pull the pair below $83,000.
Hedera price analysis
Hedera rose above the 20-day EMA ($0.22) and reached the 50-day SMA ($0.26) on March 1.

The 20-day EMA is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will signal a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. The bulls will again try to propel the HBAR/USDT pair above the 50-day SMA. If they can pull it off, the pair may rise to $0.32.
Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests that the bears remain sellers on rallies. The pair may slump to $0.18, where the bulls will try to arrest the decline.

The pair turned down from $0.26 but is likely to find support at the 20-EMA on the four-hour chart. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA with force, it will signal buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a rally to $0.28.
Instead, if the price continues lower and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are losing their grip. The pair may tumble to the 50-SMA, which is likely to act as strong support.
Litecoin price analysis
Litecoin has been trading inside a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the buyers and sellers.
LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The flattish 20-day EMA ($122) and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price rises and sustains above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to push the LTC/USDT pair above the resistance line. If they succeed, the pair may rise to $147.
Contrarily, a close below the moving averages suggests that the short-term advantage has tilted in favor of the bears. The pair may skid to the support line, which is a crucial level for the bulls to defend because a break below it may sink the pair to $86.

The pair has dipped below the moving averages on the four-hour chart, indicating that the bears are trying to take charge. If the price sustains below the moving averages, the pair could descend to $114 and then to the support line.
Buyers will have to push and maintain the price above the moving averages to open the doors for a rise to $132 and later to the resistance line. The up move could pick up momentum after the price closes above the resistance line.

The flattish 20-day EMA ($224) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that the XMR/USDT pair may swing between $205 and $245 for a few days. If the price stays above the 20-day EMA, the pair could retest the $245 resistance.
On the contrary, if buyers fail to maintain the price above the moving averages, it will suggest a lack of demand at higher levels. The bears will then try to pull the price down to the support of the range at $205.
XMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The 20-EMA has started to turn up on the four-hour chart, and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating an advantage to buyers. The pair could rise to $238, where the bears are expected to step in.
On the downside, a break and close below the 20-EMA suggests that the bears are back in the game. The pair may slide to $216, and if this level cracks, the next stop could be the solid support at $205.
Celestia price analysis
Celestia has risen above the moving averages, and the bulls are trying to sustain the price above the breakdown level of $4.14.
TIA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
If they manage to do that, it will signal that the markets have rejected the breakdown. There is minor resistance at $4.50, but if the level is crossed, the TIA/USDT pair could climb to $5.50. Sellers are expected to defend the $5.50 level aggressively.
This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($3.66). That could sink the pair to $3 and subsequently to $2.72. Such a move will suggest that the bears have flipped the $4.14 level into resistance.
TIA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
Both moving averages have started to turn up, and the RSI is in positive territory on the four-hour chart, indicating an advantage to buyers. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the moving averages. If that happens, the pair could drop to $3.40 and later to $3.
If buyers want to retain the advantage, they will have to defend the 20-EMA and quickly push the price above $4.31. The $4.50 level may prove to be a stiff resistance, but if the buyers overcome it, the pair could jump to $5.

Reduced weekend order book liquidity thus ensured swift gains across crypto markets, with BTC/USD almost hitting $92,000 on Bitstamp.
“Market changes happen when nobody expects it,” crypto trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe responded on X. 
“The last crash, probably the biggest manipulation ever for people to scoop up big positions in $BTC and $ETH. The bottom is in. The low is in on Altcoins. The final easy cycle has started.”

The run to local highs thus sealed upside of 17% versus the multimonth bottom near $78,000 seen just two days prior.
As part of the volatility, XRP managed to surpass ETH by fully diluted valuation (FDV). 
“This is what crypto has been waiting for,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter added in part of its own reaction.

In addition to the absence of strong spot demand, trader Horse added that Bitcoin returns through the weekend could trend down based on traders’ interpretation of President Trump’s comments throughout the weekend. 
“I’m guessing that BTC returns over the weekends will continue to go more negative than they already are, as tradfi uses it to hedge for anything Trump says before Sunday futs open.” 
While the consensus among traders appears to project choppy price action for Bitcoin over the coming weeks, the 29% drawdown from the $110,000 all-time high is not extraordinary for BTC. As pointed out by crypto trader ‘intern,’ 30% corrections are par for the course during Bitcoin bull markets, and historically, they have proven to be optimal purchase opportunities.

XRP price to $18K? — One crypto ‘research’ group says it’s possible,https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-price-to-18-k-one-crypto-research-group-says-it-is-possible,2025-03-01,"The speculative nature of cryptocurrencies personifies the idea that “anything is fair game” when it comes to valuation. These analyses can thread a thin line between being respectable or ridiculed. In 2018-2019, tossing the idea of a $100,000 Bitcoin price was considered so absurd that renowned economists took offense and condemned the mere thoughts of such statements.

army. 
After President Trump’s election victory, XRP price reached new highs, re-testing its all-time high of $3.41. After four years of the SEC breathing down on Ripple’s neck, the infamous securities case still awaits a resolution. 
As a result of XRP rallying to new all-time highs, even larger predictions like “$XRP to $100” or “$XRP to $1,000” have flooded social media platforms over the past 3 months. 
However, one unique research report takes the predictions to new highs, with the analyst forecasting an $18,000 price target for XRP.
XRP to $18,000?
In June 2023, a month before XRP was declared “not a security” by Judge Analisa Torres, a valuation white paper named “A Comprehensive Approach To Determine The Fair Market Value Of XRP” was released. 
The white paper was published by Valhill Capital, where multiple authors presented five valuation models to evaluate XRP’s long-term price, with “XRP Valuation Model #4” taking the sweet spot as the most ideal outlook based on token utility and future global adoption. 
Utilizing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach, the basic assumption taken was that Ripple would handle a large portion of global transactions in the next 10 years, generating fees on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and possibly tokenizing a substantial portion of global wealth, while replacing traditional remittance systems likes SWIFT. The valuation analysis was carried out based on the following data: 
Base Global Transaction Volume: $104 Trillion
Economic Growth Rate (Over 10 years, 2023-2032): 2%
Applied Discount Rate: 10%
Total Transaction Present Value: $915 Trillion
XRP Circulating Supply: $50.7 billion
Price per XRP: $18,036

In a perfect world for Ripple Labs and XRP, where the XRP ledger becomes the bedrock of the global financial remittance system, the XRP army would have the wealth to go to war with any independent nation (pun intended).
Jokes aside, taking the model at face value in 2025, Cointelegraph analyzed if the expected adoption rate is progressing as predicted. 
Fact-checking XRP rumors and reality
As of Feb. 28, 2025, there is no official confirmation from any authoritative source that XRP has been fully incorporated by a US bank for cross-border payments or internal transactions.
RippleNet, Ripple’s global payments network, has been linked with multiple US banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup but officially, only PNC Bank and Bank of America have definitive evidence-based partnerships.

Regarding Bank of America (BofA), one clip that went viral on X includes Sound Planning Group CEO David Stryzewski stating that the financial institution has been utilizing RippleNet and XRP for “100% of its internal transactions” for two years. However, the inconsistency in data is bluntly evident. The average daily internal transactions carried out by a financial institution of BofA size is around 1.2 to 1.5 million. 
XRP ledger payments statistics. Source: xrpscan
XRPL has not managed transactional operations of that size for any two years since 2018. Stryzewkski also mentioned that XRP was the second largest crypto asset before the SEC filed its securities case against Ripple on Dec. 22, 2020. The last time XRP was above Ethereum based on market capitalization was in January 2019, almost two years before the SEC knocked on the door.
Another incident that caps off the speculatory nature of XRP developments stems at Wells Fargo’s expense. In August 2024, Wells Fargo allegedly approved using XRP for settling credit card and loan payments, which Rick Lange, a certified financial planner, extensively spoke about on LinkedIn. However, Vittorio DiBenedetto, a Wells Fargo employee, left a comment in January 2025, stating, 
“Not true. Why spread fake news?”
Will XRP and Ripple take over legacy payment systems?
To be fair, XRP price has performed well over the past 12 months and there are reasons to be optimistic. Cointelegraph has extensively reported on multiple spot XRP ETFs filed by various fund managers in February, indicating potential upside for XRP in the future.
However, regarding XRP’s adoption and its goal of becoming the cash flow value pipeline of the world, RippleNet and XRP are nowhere close to the projections made in the white paper. The probability of XRP being worth $18,036 by 2030 is infinitesimally small.

"Bitcoin’s ‘Trump trade’ is over — Traders shift hope to Fed rate cuts, expanding global liquidity",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-trump-trade-is-over-will-fed-rate-cuts-and-m2-expansion-help,2025-03-01,"Financial markets are sending mixed signals as uncertainty reaches new highs. On Feb. 25, the US debt ceiling was raised from $36.1 trillion to $40.1 trillion, marking another massive expansion in government borrowing.
Following a historical pattern, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield reacted to the news by dropping from 4.4% to 4.29%. While this may seem counterintuitive, markets tend to interpret debt ceiling resolutions as stabilizing events, reducing near-term uncertainty even if they imply higher borrowing down the line.
However, the stock and crypto markets, which usually benefit from lower bond yields as capital rotates into risk assets, have continued their fall that started last week. Since Feb. 21, the S&P 500 has lost 3%, the Nasdaq100 has dropped 5%, and Bitcoin has plunged 16%. The leading cryptocurrency is now trading 26% below its all-time high reached on President Donald Trump’s Inauguration Day, effectively erasing the Trump pump. 
A simultaneous decline in stocks and bond yields is not typical market behavior and suggests growing risk aversion and economic slowdown fears. 
Economic uncertainty looms over markets
Recent US economic data released on Feb. 21 has shown notable signs of weakness. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index fell to 64.7 in February, down from 71.7 in January. This marks the lowest level since November 2023 and came in below the preliminary estimate of 67.8, which was also the consensus forecast among economists polled by Reuters. 
Existing home sales dropped 4.9%, and the S&P Global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell from 52.7 in January to 50.4, the lowest since Sept. 2023. PMI tracks manufacturing and services activity, and a reading barely above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction indicates stagnating growth in the private sector.
Trade tensions add to market uncertainty. On Feb. 24, Trump said that tariffs on Canada and Mexico “will go forward” after the deadline for the monthlong delay ends next week. Trump’s plan to impose 25% tariffs on the European Union, revealed on Feb. 26, and an additional 10% levy on Chinese goods added to the growing market anxiety 
In commentary to CNBC, Chris Rupkey, Chief Economist at FWDBonds, unapologetically said, 
“The economy is about to have the rug pulled out from under it as Washington policies are causing a rapid loss of confidence on the part of consumers.” 
Rupkey elaborated, “The economy is coming in for a crash landing this year. Bet on it. The bond market is.”

A small crisis to justify quantitative easing?
In January, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes speculated that a battle over the debt ceiling—combined with a reluctance to spend down the Treasury General Account—could push 10-year Treasury yields above 5%, triggering a stock market crash and forcing the the Federal Reserve to intervene. 
In his view, this could help President Trump to pressure the Fed into adopting a mode dovish stance. In other words, a small crisis to justify the QE and stimulate the economy. 
For Hayes, this mini-crisis must occur early in Trump’s presidency, during  Q1 or Q2, so he could blame it on the leverage built up during the Biden administration. 
“A mini financial crisis in the US would provide the monetary mana crypto craves. It would also be politically expedient for Trump. I think we pull back to the previous all-time high and give back all of the Trump bump.”
Ironically, even though the debt ceiling was raised with minimal drama, and 10-year Treasury yields have actually fallen, the stock market still dropped. The most pressing question now is whether this will lead to interest rate cuts.
The Fed remains neutral, with recent economic data providing little reason for an imminent policy shift. The latest CPI report on Feb. 11 showed inflation accelerating to 0.5% month-over-month, pushing the annual rate to 3%, both exceeding expectations. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that the central bank won’t rush to cut rates further. Despite this position, a combination of weakening economic indicators and liquidity expansion may eventually force the Fed’s hand later this year.

Bitcoin price and M2 changes have different paces
Despite the current market downturn, not all hope is lost, as a massive wave of liquidity expansion could be on the horizon. The expanding M2 global liquidity supply could breathe fresh air into the risk-on markets, especially Bitcoin. However, this might take some time.
The M2 Global Liquidity Index 3-Month Offset provides a useful framework for forecasting liquidity-driven market movements. This indicator shifts M2 money supply data forward by three months to analyze its relationship with risk assets.
Crypto analyst Crypto Rover highlighted this on X, stating:
“Global liquidity strengthening significantly. Bitcoin will follow soon.”
Bitcoin vs M2 Global Liquidity Index (3M offset). Source: CryptoRover
The historical performance shows that BTC usually lags approximately 60 days behind major global liquidity movements. The current drop inscribes perfectly into this picture, which also promises a strong rebound by June if liquidity trends hold.
Jeff Park, head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, echoed the sentiment: 
“Bitcoin can certainly go lower in the short term as it thrives on trend and volatility, both recently absent. But astute institutional investors don’t need to catch every wave; they just can’t miss the biggest one. And the biggest wave of global liquidity is coming this year.”
Jamie Coutts, a crypto analyst from Realvision, also shared his views on how liquidity expansion impacts Bitcoin price. 
“2 of 3 core liquidity measures in my framework [global money supply and central bank balance sheets] have turned bullish this month as markets dive. Historically, this has been very favorable for Bitcoin. Dollar is the next domino. Confluence is king.”

Since Feb. 24, Solana has formed a series of lower lows leading up to its yearly low at $125 on Friday. During this period, a clear bullish divergence formed between the price and relative strength index (RSI).

As illustrated in the chart, the rally on the 4-hour chart took place at the back of these bullish divergences. The bullish signal led to BTC’s swing pattern failure on the 1-day chart.
A swing pattern failure is a trend reversal indicator that is utilized to observe weakness in the dominant trend and identify potential reversals.

As analyzed, Solana is currently looking to close above its previous three days, and a confirmed close above $143 will validate the bullish SFP. The relief rally occurred following the RSI entering an oversold territory, marking its lowest level since June 2023, when Solana was priced at $15.
The immediate overhead resistance remains at $160. Flipping this level into support will further validate $125 as the local bottom.

Will SOL sell-off again in March?
As widely discussed over the past month, Solana’s token unlocks go live on March 1, which will see 11.2 million SOL entering the circulating supply. There will be a 2.84% increase in the total market cap, which is worth $1.62 billion at the moment.
The unlock event is largely investor-based, with companies such as Galaxy, Pantera and Figure looking to secure between $150 million to $3 billion in unrealized gains.
While the larger market expects volatility after the event, Keyrock Trading, a crypto markets maker platform, predicted the outcome based on analysis data from more than 16,000 token events.
Keyrock Trading highlighted that investor-based unlocks witnessed an average of 5% correction 30 days before the event. In this case, SOL suffered a significant 60% decline over the past month.
Weighted unlock per category. Source: X.com
The platform termed the unlock event as a medium-size (1-5% supply) and stated,
“Medium unlocks historically see an ~8% decline within 30 days post-unlock.”
Based on the data, SOL is expected to witness some form of downward pressure for the short term after March 1. Jeremy, a crypto trader, predicted another lower low is on the cards for the altcoin, where Solana may form a bottom around $110-$120. However, the trader remained open to the scenario of $125 being a strong support level.

ETF options trading on the US exchange, according to a Feb. 28 regulatory filing. 
Cboe initially requested to list Ether ETF options in August 2024, but the SEC sought extra time to reach a decision in October. 
The exchange is seeking to list options on the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH). The fund is among the more popular Ether ETFs, with around $1.3 billion in net assets, according to data from VettaFi. 
On Feb. 7, the SEC sent a similar response to another US securities exchange, Nasdaq ISE. The agency intends to decide by April if the exchange can list options tied to BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). 
BlackRock’s fund is the largest ETH ETF, with more than $3.7 billion in net assets, VettaFi’s data shows.
Creating an options market for ETH ETFs is an important step toward widespread adoption. Spot Ether ETFs were listed in July 2024 and have proceeded to attract approximately $11 billion in net assets, according to VettaFi’s data. 
Options are contracts granting the right to buy or sell — “call” or “put,” in trader parlance — an underlying asset at a certain price.

Bitcoin rebounds to $84K — Analysts say BTC crash was ultimate buy signal,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-rebounds-to-84-k-analysts-say-btc-crash-was-ultimate-buy-signal,2025-03-01,"Bitcoin
BTC
$82,470
price dropped 21.3% between Feb. 21 and Feb. 28, retesting the $78,300 level for the first time since November 2024. The correction led to over $1.6 billion in leveraged long (buy) liquidations, adding to market volatility as exchanges forcefully sold contracts. The $21,210 decline marked the largest seven-day drop in Bitcoin’s history.
Despite the pullback, several Bitcoin analysts see this as a strong buying opportunity. They cite factors such as regulatory developments, sovereign fund exposure, onchain and technical signals, and increasing integration with traditional finance, including bank adoption as collateral and structured product offerings.

User Obviously_Obv, reportedly a Web3 game researcher at Sigil Fund, stated that the current price action resembles a “bear trap,” as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hit its lowest levels since 2022. He also claimed that government entities worldwide are “about to buy Bitcoin,” not just the U.S.
Similarly, Eric Weiss, CEO of Blockchain Investment Group LP, shared a report from Tephra Digital outlining key events that could drive higher adoption rates and positively impact Bitcoin’s price.

According to the report, the next steps include in-kind creation and redemption for Bitcoin ETF issuers in the US, improving market efficiency. Another key factor is the legal classification of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, which would allow BTC deposits to be used as collateral, similar to gold. Analysts also highlight increasing exposure from sovereign wealth funds and the approval of solicited sales by banks as potential catalysts for wider Bitcoin adoption.

According to the analyst, traders should “soak up the cheap coins” as the “opportunity won’t last forever.” From an onchain analysis perspective, data suggests that long-term holders were not the main contributors to Bitcoin’s drop below $80,000, increasing the likelihood of a swift recovery above $95,000.

User CarlBMenger, author of the Carl ₿ Menger's Newsletter, noted that “74% of the realized Bitcoin losses came from holders who bought in the last month.” He added that inexperienced traders are folding under pressure, while seasoned investors remain unaffected by the price fluctuation.
Beyond the potential buying pressure from nation-states, Luke Broyles, a collaborator at Blockware Mining, explained on X that a single US-listed company could acquire 84,090 BTC. This would make it the second-largest holder after Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which currently holds 499,096 BTC.
Source: luke_broyles
Broyles’ hypothesis assumes the company would use its entire cash and equivalent position to buy Bitcoin at $88,000 and raise an additional $3 billion in debt to increase holdings at $110,000. However, even if GameStop allocated only 20% of its current reserves, that would represent 11,765 BTC at $85,000—enough to secure the fourth-largest position behind MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms.

Different analysis models suggest that buying Bitcoin below $85,000 is a golden opportunity, one that may not be available for long. Bitcoin's censorship resistance and digital scarcity features have not been impacted by the worsening macroeconomic environment. In time, its price is expected to rise above $100,000, reflecting the conviction of its current holders and benefiting from deeper integration into the traditional finance system.

BlackRock adds BTC ETF to model portfolio,https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-adds-btc-etf-150-b-model-portfolio-product,2025-03-01,"Update (March 11 at 18:39 UTC): This article has been updated to include a statement from BlackRock.
BlackRock, a global investment firm with $11.5 trillion in assets under management, has added its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to its model portfolio product, according to a Feb. 28 report from Bloomberg.
Portfolios that allow for alternative assets will be able to put a 1%–2% allocation into the firm’s iShares Bitcoin ETF Trust (IBIT), potentially creating new demand for the exchange-traded fund.
The 1%–2% allocation is due to Bitcoin’s

volatility, which the firm called a “reasonable range” in a paper authored by the BlackRock Investment Institute. Anything more would significantly increase the crypto’s share of the total portfolio risk.
BlackRock’s $150-billion model portfolio contains a range of investment products that are sold to financial advisers who manage assets for their clients. The portfolios contain different balances of investments, with some targeted for growth, income generation or capital preservation.
“The addition of IBIT to these portfolios as a diversifier are in line with the investment objectives of this model, as Target Allocation with Alternatives portfolios are designed for investors with a higher risk budget and growth target,"" a BlackRock spokesperson told Cointelegraph.

The firm said in 2023 that it expects the model portfolio sector of money management to grow to a $ 10-trillion business over the next five years, up from around $4.2 trillion at the time of the statement. Changes in model portfolio allocations can often have dramatic effects on money flow to certain investments.
Other financial services firms have weighed in on the allocation of Bitcoin to the alternatives category of traditional portfolios like the 60/40 portfolio. Fidelity noted in 2024 that Bitcoin could “offer some return-enhancing properties, but small allocations could contribute exponential risk to a 60/40 portfolio.” JPMorgan wrote in December 2024: “While Bitcoin’s returns have been impressive, they’ve come with extraordinary volatility.”

Bitcoin volatility on display as BlackRock’s BTC ETF sees outflows
The volatility of Bitcoin was on full display on Feb. 28, with the coin seeing a high of $85,122 and a low of $78,215. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has not been immune to the macroclimate that has spooked investors, including the threat of a global trade war and US economic uncertainty.
BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has felt the effects as well, with investors pulling out $420 million on Feb. 26 alone, the largest outflow since the iShares Bitcoin ETF Trust launched in January 2024. Other Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows on Feb. 26 as well, with preliminary figures from CoinGlass showing $756 million leaving the funds.

Despite the outflows, Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for the firm’s Target Allocation ETF model suite, wrote in an investment commentary dated Feb. 27, “We believe Bitcoin has long-term investment merit and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios.”
On Feb. 26, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a key tracker of Bitcoin and crypto sentiment, had slipped to “extreme fear” or a score of “10.” That level had not been seen since June 2022, when Three Arrows Capital (3AC) started to see its downfall.

BTC
$82,481
dropped close to $78,000 on Feb. 28, but lower levels attracted solid buying by the bulls. CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju said in a post on X that selling after a 30% correction could be a “noob” mistake as Bitcoin rose to a new all-time high after falling 53% in 2021.
Select whales seem to be building a position during the dip. A Bitcoin whale, known as “Spoofy,” bought 4,000 Bitcoin worth roughly $344 million when the price was between $82,000 and $85,000. Crypto analyst Saint Pump said on X that Spoofy builds his position “extremely slowly” and may buy more if the markets fall further.

The current correction has not deterred Standard Chartered’s long-term view. In a CNBC interview, Standard Chartered head of digital assets research Geoffrey Kendrick said that Bitcoin could recover to $200,000 this year and surge to $500,000 before President Trump finishes his second term. 
Could Bitcoin start a recovery, pulling altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.
Bitcoin price analysis
Bitcoin closed below the $85,000 support on Feb. 26, and the bears successfully defended the level on Feb. 27.
BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
Sellers tried to sink the BTC/USDT pair to $73,777, but the bulls purchased the dip to $78,258 on Feb. 28. Buyers will try to push the price back above the $85,000 to $90,000 resistance zone. If they manage to do that, it will suggest that a short-term bottom may be in place.
Conversely, if the price turns down sharply from the overhead resistance zone, it indicates selling on every minor rally. The pair could then descend to the vital support at $73,777, where buyers are expected to step in.
Ether price analysis
Ether
ETH

rebounded off the $2,111 support, indicating that the bulls are trying to keep the price inside the large range.
ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The bulls will attempt to stretch the recovery to the 20-day EMA ($2,611) and then to the downtrend line. Sellers are expected to aggressively defend the downtrend line. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the ETH/USDT pair could retest the $2,111 level. If this support cracks, the pair may sink to $2,000 and later to $1,900.
Contrary to this assumption, a break and close above the downtrend line suggests that the bears are losing their grip. The pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($2,932). 
XRP price analysis

The XRP/USDT pair dipped below the $2.06 support on Feb. 28, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. Buyers will attempt to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If they can pull it off, it will signal that the bulls are back in the game.
Contrarily, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. That increases the possibility of a drop to the crucial support at $1.77.
BNB price analysis
BNB
BNB
$577.87
rebounded off the support near $557, indicating that the bulls are trying to defend the level.
BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The BNB/USDT pair will attempt a relief rally, which is expected to face strong selling at the 20-day EMA ($634). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, it increases the likelihood of a break below $557. If that happens, the pair could collapse to $500. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $460 and $500.
On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA suggests the selling pressure is reducing. The pair could then reach the 50-day SMA ($656).
Solana price analysis
Solana
SOL
$125.40
slipped below the $133 support on Feb. 28, but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels.
SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
There is minor resistance at $147, but it is likely to be crossed. If the price holds above $147, the SOL/USDT pair could reach the 20-day EMA ($169). Sellers are expected to pose a strong challenge at the 20-day EMA, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could extend its recovery to the 50-day SMA ($201).
This optimistic view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below $125. The pair could then plummet to $110.
Dogecoin price analysis
Buyers failed to push Dogecoin
DOGE
$0.1697
back above the support line, suggesting that the bears have flipped the level into resistance.
DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The selling resumed on Feb. 28, and the bears will try to sink the price to $0.15. However, the RSI has slipped into the oversold zone, suggesting that a relief rally could be around the corner. Buyers will have to push and maintain the DOGE/USDT pair above the 20-day EMA ($0.24) to start a sustained recovery.
The failure to push the price back above the 20-day EMA increases the risk of a drop to $0.13 and then to $0.10.
Cardano price analysis
Cardano
ADA
$0.7146
is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the support line of the descending channel pattern.
ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
If the price sustains below the support line, the selling could pick up, and the ADA/USDT pair may drop to $0.50. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.50 level with all their might because a close below it could sink the pair to $0.33.
If the price turns up from the support line, the pair could reach the 20-day EMA (0.73). This is a vital overhead resistance to watch out for because a break above it suggests that the pair may remain inside the channel for some more time.

Litecoin price analysis
Litecoin
LTC
$89.70
has been oscillating inside a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears.
LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The 20-day EMA ($122) is flattish, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If the price sustains above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to push the LTC/USDT pair above the resistance line. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $147.
Conversely, a break below the 50-day SMA ($117) opens the gates for a drop to the support line. If this level gives way, the pair could plunge to $80.
Chainlink price analysis
The failure of the bulls to start a strong recovery from the support line triggered another round of selling by the bears in Chainlink

.
LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
If the price sustains below the support line, the selling could accelerate, and the LINK/USDT pair could drop to $12.71 and, subsequently, to $10.
If buyers want to prevent the downside, they will have to swiftly push the price back above $16. The pair could then rise to the 20-day EMA ($17.42), which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. Buyers will have to push the price above the 20-day EMA to suggest that the break below the support line may have been a bear trap.
Avalanche price analysis
Avalanche
AVAX
$18.93
tried to rise above the breakdown level of $22.35 on Feb. 27, but the bears held their ground. 
AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView
The bears resumed selling on Feb. 28. If the price breaks and maintains below $20, the AVAX/USDT pair could retest the solid support at $17.29. This is an important level to watch out for because a break below it may sink the pair to $15.
Time is running out for the bulls. They will have to push and maintain the price above the 20-day EMA ($24.55) to start a recovery. The pair may rise to $27.50, which is again expected to act as a resistance.

Bitcoin’s 60-day RCV hints at low-risk accumulation
Crazzyblock, a Bitcoin trader and verified analyst on CryptoQuant said that Bitcoin’s 60-day RCV reached its lowest level of -1.9 in the chart, signaling an ‘optimal DCA opportunity’ for the first time since July 2024. 
Bitcoin 60-day RCV chart. Source: CryptoQuant
The 60-day realized value to market capitalization variance (RCV) is a metric that calculates the 60-day rolling average and standard deviation of BTC price. According to the metric, whenever the RCV value is below 0.30, it indicates a low-risk investment in the asset. A value between 0.30-0.50 implies a neutral environment, and above 0.5 means a high sell-off risk. 
The analyst pointed out that the metric has been historically accurate in identifying undervaluation and overvaluation trends for BTC, and the current normalized RCV value presents a favorable buying opportunity based on “historical risk-reward dynamics.” The BTC proponent added,

“Long-term investors should consider scaling into BTC positions via a DCA strategy as risk-adjusted conditions remain optimal.”
In 2024, the RCV value flashed a DCA signal between May and July, where Bitcoin fluctuated between $70,000 and $50,000. Thus, it is essential to note that the RCV does not signal a bottom but highlights the low-risk, high probability of making gains in the long term. 
Crypto analyst Yonsei Dent pointed out that Bitcoin’s short-term holder SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio), which monitors realized profit or losses, had reached a sharp deviation below the lower Bolling Band.

Based on such deviations, BTC has registered a short-term rebound between 8%-42%, with recoveries also evident during the 2022 bear market.

Bitcoin wallets with 10+ BTC dump 6,813 coins
Data from Santiment suggests that BTC’s price has been correlated with the accumulation and distribution behavior of wallets holding 10+ BTC. Whenever these addresses accumulate, Bitcoin progressively increases in value.

Santiment also highlighted that the “key stakeholders” have dumped roughly 6,813 BTC over the past week, its most extensive distribution since July 2024. 
Similarly, Ki-Young Ju pointed out that Bitcoin’s spot ETF demand is weak, suggesting that a “price recovery could take some time.”

BTC price pushes past $82,000 on PCE relief
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD bouncing more than 5% from its latest multimonth lows of $78,197 on Bitstamp.
Ongoing selling pressure only eased as the latest US macroeconomic data conformed to expectations on inflation.
The January print of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, known to be the Federal Reserve’s “preferred” inflation gauge, came in at 0.3% and 2.5% month-on-month and year-on-year, respectively.
Markets immediately sensed relief after several recent overshoots in inflation data. In a boost to both risk assets and crypto, US dollar strength began falling from local highs of 107.45, a level not seen in two weeks.

Macro tightening “fully reflected” in $80,000 Bitcoin
Commenting on the impact that the macro climate could have on Bitcoin, meanwhile, Julien Bittel, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor, had good news for bulls.
Related: When will Bitcoin price bottom?
“Everything happening in markets right now, especially in crypto, is a direct consequence of the tightening of financial conditions in Q4 last year,” he argued in part of his latest X analysis on the day. 
“When financial conditions tighten, liquidity gets drained, and economic surprises start to slow.”

Bittel suggested that the “scare” affecting markets would not last much longer.
“Here’s the thing: This will all reverse next month,” he forecast. 
“Financial conditions have been easing rapidly over the past two months – dollar down, bond yields down, oil down – and that’s setting the stage for a recovery in the data soon. Remember, financial conditions are always leading.”
Bitcoin at $80,000, he concluded, means tighter conditions were “fully reflected” in BTC price action.
“Everyone’s already on the same side of the trade – sentiment is extremely bearish, and Bitcoin is sitting at an RSI of 23, the most oversold level since August 2023,” he noted.
